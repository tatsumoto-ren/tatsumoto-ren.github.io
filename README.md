This is my personal [site](https://tatsumoto-ren.github.io/).
Here I discuss planting, growing, and harvesting cabbage.
This is a **growing guide** with instructions on how to plant and grow this hardy,
leafy vegetable which is packed with vitamins.
I also cover carrots a lot.
Garden-grown carrots are full of flavor and texture!
Carrots are easy to grow as long as they are planted in loose,
sandy soil during the cooler periods of the growing season.
