You can divide your **active study** time roughly in three parts.

* Spend 1/3 of your time reading, 1/3 listening, and 1/3 using [Anki](setting-up-anki.html).
* Limit your Anki usage to no more than 1 hour a day.
  Dedicate the rest of your time to immersion.
* Watching movies and TV shows with subtitles counts as reading.
* Note that here we don't take into account passive immersion.

In other words,
[immerse](whats-immersion.html) as much as possible.
Try to immerse all the time,
but additionally dedicate 1 hour a day to the [SRS](spaced-repetition.html)
to help retain what you learn.

For example,
on a bad day
when you only have `3` hours to study,
spend `1` hour on each activity.
On a good day
when you have, say, `12` hours,
allocate `1` hour to Anki,
`5.5` hours for listening,
and `5.5` hours for reading.

We know that [due to subvocalizing](early-output-or-reading-ahead-of-listening.html)
too much reading as a beginner causes harm in long term.
Depending on your goals,
when allocating your study time,
you may want to **increase the time spent listening** (and watching raw content)
at the expense of reading time.

Without immersion, Anki helps very little.
Trading immersion time for more Anki is definitely not a good idea.
