You pick it up through immersion over time.
If you study it deliberately, it's difficult.

Kansai-ben is not so different from Standard Japanese.
Most differences come down to surface-level things like sentence endings and suffixes.
Pitch accent is pretty different,
but you don't have to learn [Keihan accent](https://wikiless.org/wiki/%E4%BA%AC%E9%98%AA%E5%BC%8F%E3%82%A2%E3%82%AF%E3%82%BB%E3%83%B3%E3%83%88?lang=ja) to understand it.
If you want to learn to speak it, that's where you have to learn a lot.

In almost every anime or drama there's a character that speaks the dialect.
The amount of exposure you get is significant enough
to learn to understand it through exposure alone.
