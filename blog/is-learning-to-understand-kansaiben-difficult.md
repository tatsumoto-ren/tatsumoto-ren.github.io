You can pick it up through immersion over time.
However,
if you study it deliberately,
it can be difficult.

Kansai-ben is not so different from Standard Japanese.
Most differences are surface-level,
such as sentence endings and suffixes.
The [pitch accent](japanese-pitch-accents.html) is pretty different,
but you don't need to learn
the [Keihan accent](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E4%BA%AC%E9%98%AA%E5%BC%8F%E3%82%A2%E3%82%AF%E3%82%BB%E3%83%B3%E3%83%88?lang=ja)
to understand it.
If you want to learn to speak Kansai-ben,
that's where you'll need to put in more effort.

In nearly every anime or drama,
there's a character who speaks the dialect.
The amount of exposure you get is significant enough
to learn to understand it just through immersion.
