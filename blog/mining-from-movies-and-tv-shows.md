[Sentence mining](sentence-mining.html)
is the process of picking sentences from your immersion and making Anki cards.
Each sentence has one unknown piece of information,
which is referred to as *target word*.

To mine sentences from movies and TV-shows
you are going to need the `mpv` video player,
and a plugin for mpv called Mpvacious.

****

## MPV

<img float="right" src="img/movies.webp" alt="movies and tv shows">

`mpv` is the best video player for language learners.
It is fast, minimal, extensible and compatible with all video formats.
`mpv` is available on most distributions of GNU/Linux.
To install it on Arch Linux, execute the following command:

```
$ sudo pacman -S mpv
```

Make sure you have version 0.33.0 or later.
If such a version is not available on your distribution, see
[here](https://mpv.io/installation/)
for different installation options.

## MPV configuration

Start `mpv` at least once to create the config folder
which will be located at `~/.config/mpv/`.

`mpv` reads its configuration from the following directories/files:

* `~/.config/mpv/mpv.conf`.
  The main config file.
  Contains settings related to the player itself.
* `~/.config/mpv/input.conf`. Key bindings.
  Apart from the player's key bindings,
  it can also contain key bindings of third-party user-scripts.
* `~/.config/mpv/scripts`.
  Contains user-scrips.
  User scripts are small programs that extend the player's functionality.
  Usually each user-script is installed in its own folder.
* `~/.config/mpv/script-opts`.
  Config files used by the installed user-scripts.
  Some user-scripts don't have configuration files.

Note that
not all the directories or files listed above are created automatically.

To configure mpv,
create and open `~/.config/mpv/mpv.conf`.
This step is not strictly necessary.

**Note:**
To tell mpv to show subtitles in the font you selected in the config, press `u`.
If you want to make the setting permanent, add `sub-ass-override=force` to `mpv.conf`.

`~/.config/mpv/input.conf` contains key bindings.
For all available bindings, see `/usr/share/doc/mpv/input.conf`.

## Obtain content

Always download what you watch.
This way it's easier to work with the files,
make Anki cards,
take screenshots,
cut clips,
[make condensed audio](passive-listening.html),
and so on.
Don't use "services" that spy on you such as Netflix, Hulu, VRV, Funimation or Crunchyroll.

Attempts to create flashcards from streamed video files often fail.
As a workaround,
the user can record audio and take a screenshot manually,
but it is not convenient at all.

Explore [Immersion material](resources.html#immersion-material) to find Japanese content
and [Download tools](resources.html#downloading) for a ways to download it.

## Obtain subtitles

To learn Japanese from visual content such as anime or jdramas,
you need Japanese subtitles.
Subtitles can be found on the [Resources page](resources.html#japanese-subtitles).

I find that it's easier to download all the subtitles for all the shows and have them saved locally.
This may require a few GiB of disk space,
but it will save you the hassle of having to visit subtitle catalogs
every time you need to find subtitles.
For example, if you download
the [mirror of kitsunekko](https://github.com/Ajatt-Tools/kitsunekko-mirror),
you can use
[lf](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Lf) to browse it,
and [fzf](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Fzf) to search it.
[Watch a demonstration on ![YouTube](img/youtube_logo.webp)](https://redirect.invidious.io/watch?v=WVDRbR7C6js).

	<source src="https://invidious.private.coffee/latest_version?id=WVDRbR7C6js&itag=22" type="video/mp4">
	<source src="vid/search_anime_subtitles.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>

In the video,
I'm using a [shell alias](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Bash#Aliases)
to enter the directory with Japanese anime subtitles.
I'm also using keyboard shortcuts to call `fzf` and `lf`.
Shortcuts and aliases can be
[configured](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Zsh#Configure_Zsh) in the `.zshrc` file.

```
# Change directory
alias subs='cd -- "/path/to/directory"'
# Ctrl+O to launch lf file manager.
bindkey -s '^o' '^ulf\n'
# Ctrl+F to search directory with fzf.
bindkey -s '^f' '^ucd -- "$(dirname -- "$(fzf)")"\n'
```

To create your own local mirror of `kitsunekko`,
use [kitsunekko-tools](https://github.com/Ajatt-Tools/kitsunekko-tools).
This simple program downloads all files from `kitsunekko`
and saves them in a specified directory on your hard drive.
You need roughly `8` GiB on your disk
to store a copy of the entire subtitle catalogue.

If you can't find target language subtitles for a video,
you can generate them using [pyTranscriber](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/pytranscriber-bin).
You're going to get <abbr title="with errors">cursed subtitles</abbr>, but it's better than nothing.
I have used it a few times for Japanese.

If you want to synchronize the subtitles, see
[Retiming subtitles](retiming-subtitles.html).

Sometimes the only subtitle files
available for a particular video are image-based (`.sup` or `.sub`).
Often this is the case with subtitles for movies.
They don't contain any text and by themselves are not very useful.
SUP files can be converted to plain text (`.srt`)
using OCR (Optical Character Recognition) programs
such as [subtitleedit](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/subtitleedit).

Don't forget that if you have English subtitles enabled,
at best you're going to improve your English,
but your Japanese is not going to get any better.

## User-scripts for MPV

`mpv` is highly configurable and extensible,
allowing users to customize its interface and functionality.
One way to do this is through user-scripts,
which are scripts that can modify `mpv`'s behavior and add new features.
User-scripts are written in languages such as Lua or JavaScript.

You can find a list of user-scripts for `mpv` [here](https://github.com/mpv-player/mpv/wiki/User-Scripts).

## Mpvacious

[Mpvacious](https://github.com/Ajatt-Tools/mpvacious)
is a user-script for the mpv video player
that allows you to make Anki cards
while watching movies and TV shows in your target language.

Mpvacious can update Anki cards you add with Rikaitan
by filling the audio and screenshot fields.
[Watch a demonstration on ![YouTube](img/youtube_logo.webp)](https://redirect.invidious.io/watch?v=vU85ramvyo4).

	<source src="vid/sentence_mining_with_mpvacious.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>

The user-script has a long list of features and configuration options.
For details explore the documentation on GitHub.
Below I'm going to write about how I use it.

### Requirements

Mpvacious needs
[AnkiConnect](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/2055492159)
to work.
If you're using Xorg,
[xclip](https://archlinux.org/packages/extra/x86_64/xclip/)
is required to copy text to the clipboard.
[wl-copy](https://archlinux.org/packages/extra/x86_64/wl-clipboard/)
is required on Wayland.

### Installation

Mpvacious can be installed with `git`:

```
$ git clone 'https://github.com/Ajatt-Tools/mpvacious.git' ~/.config/mpv/scripts/subs2srs
```

### Configuration

Download the
[example config file](https://github.com/Ajatt-Tools/mpvacious/blob/master/.github/RELEASE/subs2srs.conf)
and save it to `~/.config/mpv/script-opts/subs2srs.conf`.
If you use the Note Type from the
[recommended mining deck](setting-up-anki.html#import-an-example-mining-deck),
you don't need to change any settings at all.
If you don't, make sure to adjust at least the following variables:
* `sentence_field`
* `audio_field`
* `image_field`

### Usage

1) Make sure Anki is running.
1) Open a video in mpv.
1) Press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>t</kbd> to activate clipboard autocopy.
1) Open [GoldenDict](setting-up-goldendict.html)
   or open your web browser and activate [Rikaitan Search](what-is-yomichan-search.html).
1) Enable GoldendDict's "Scan Popup" or enable clipboard monitor in Rikaitan Search.
1) When there is a word you want to mine, create a new card.
1) Go back to the `mpv` window and press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>m</kbd>.
   If you want to grab a sentence that spans multiple lines,
   press <kbd>a</kbd> to open the advanced menu.
   Then mark the lines you want to appear on the card
   by pressing <kbd>c</kbd> and moving the position with <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>h</kbd> and <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>l</kbd>.
   Finish by pressing <kbd>m</kbd>.
1) The Anki Browser window should appear with the card updated.

See [How to](https://github.com/Ajatt-Tools/mpvacious/tree/master/howto) for more detailed explanations.

### Creating cards without pausing

You can save sentences for later without adding definitions.
Since you don't have to pause to read the dictionary, this approach is less disruptive.
Press `Ctrl+n` to add the current subtitle line to Anki as a new card.
When you finish watching, open the Anki Browser and type `added:1` to display cards added today.
Finally, add dictionary definitions to the cards.

If you want to create a card from multiple adjacent subtitle lines,
do it using the advanced menu as described in the previous section.

### Updating

To update Mpvacious, run the command below:

```
$ cd ~/.config/mpv/scripts/subs2srs && git pull
```

## Should I use a "text hooker" page?

No.

Though you often see such recommendations,
I think it unnecessarily complicates your setup.
GoldenDict or
Rikaitan Search can do the same thing simpler.
