Just go to the next step.
Do the N5 and N4 levels of [Ankidrone Essentials](ankidrone-essentials.html),
then jump into [sentence mining](sentence-mining.html).

JP1K is made for beginners, for people who don't know any Japanese yet.
Before you start sentence mining, you need to reach the point of
[kanji fluency](learning-kanji.html#kanji-fluency).
If you have learned more than 1,000 kanji,
then it is highly likely that you already have kanji fluency.
There's no need to continue studying kanji in isolation or with a JP1K deck.
You just need to start sentence mining.
The kanji you don't know yet can be learned through learning whole words.
