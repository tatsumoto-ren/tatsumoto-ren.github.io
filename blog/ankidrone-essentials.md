*Ankidrone Essentials* is the generally recommended Anki deck for newcomers to Japanese

Since the first release in February 2020,
it has helped many people and received positive feedback.

## About

To learn the details about studying basic vocabulary,
read [this article](basic-vocabulary.html) first.

## Structure

Ankidrone Essentials contains sentences extracted from JLPT Tango books.
There are 5 subdecks.

* Ankidrone Essentials
	1) JLPT Tango `N5`
	1) JLPT Tango `N4`
	1) JLPT Tango `N3`
	1) JLPT Tango `N2`
	1) JLPT Tango `N1`

Most cards are preformatted as
[targeted sentence cards (TSC)](discussing-various-card-templates.html#targeted-sentence-cards),
the ideal card template for both beginners and advanced learners.
Note that TSCs are not regular sentence cards you find in other Anki decks on the Internet
and should be treated differently.

Each card includes speech recordings stored in
[Opus](https://opus-codec.org/) format.
It offers great compression and remarkable audio quality at low bitrates.

## Tango books

*Ankidrone Essentials* contains sentences extracted from *JLPT Tango* textbooks.
JLPT Tango textbooks are designed to prepare for the JLPT.
There are five books total, one for each level of the JLPT.
The books include vocabulary found commonly on the test and often used in everyday life.
Cards are ordered in such a way
that most sentences only introduce a single new word or grammar pattern.

The order of cards and focus on words commonly used in daily life in Japan
makes this Anki deck an ideal instrument to complete the basic vocabulary stage.

## How to study

1) Learn all cards from Tango `N5`.
1) Start [sentence mining](sentence-mining.html)
   using TV-shows with Japanese subtitles, and later manga and novels.

   > **[Sentence mining](sentence-mining.html)** is the process of finding sentences
   > with words you don't know in your immersion and making them into sentence cards.
   > Programs like [GoldenDict](setting-up-goldendict.html)
   > or the browser add-on
   > [Rikaitan](setting-up-yomichan.html)
   > simplify this process to a single click.
   > [mpvacious](https://github.com/Ajatt-Tools/mpvacious)
   > is an add-on for
   > [mpv](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Mpv)
   > that works similarly to
   > [subs2srs](our-immersion-learning-toolset.html#subs2srs)
   > and can be used together with Rikaitan
   > to create Anki cards while watching subtitled content.

   You'll learn more about sentence mining on the subsequent pages of this guide.
1) While sentence mining, learn Tango `N4`, `N3` and `N2` at a reduced pace.
   It is critical not to spend too much time on beginner decks and focus on mining.
1) The rest can be used to aid your learning process later.
   The higher level you reach, the less benefit from premade decks you will get.
   Refer to Core10k when you have trouble finding example sentences.

Remember that you have to combine your study with
[immersion](introduction-to-learning-japanese.html#how-to-immerse)
from the beginning.
Humans absorb language only through repeated massive exposure.
Anki can help you learn the vocabulary consciously,
but it cannot replace or substitute immersion.
Anki is used to help you reinforce and strengthen your memory,
notice and recognize the learned words in native Japanese.

**Note:** If you have completed the [Kanji Transition deck](jp1k-anki-deck.html),
skip Tango `N5` because they teach roughly the same words
and differ mostly in their card templates.

## How to review

To understand how to review basic vocabulary decks,
refer to [How to review](basic-vocabulary.html#how-to-review).

Key points:

* Try to recall the meaning and reading of the **marked word**.
* Use the context to understand how the word connects with other words.
* Press "Good" if your guess is correct. Otherwise, press "Again".
* Don't use the "Hard" and "Easy" buttons.
  Install [AJT Flexible Grading](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1715096333) to hide them.

## Tips

* See [basic vocabulary tips](basic-vocabulary.html#tips).
* In the Tango books they teach many country names.
  The purpose of learning them is apparently to understand self introductions
  as well as be able to give one yourself.
  You can skip them without losing too much.
* Feel free to skip katakana-words, loan-words.
  Most people who speak English can already understand them intuitively.
* People ask me why I added this or that card in the deck.
  I simply copied everything that was present in the **Tango** books.
  Delete cards you don't like.
  There is no "curriculum" in AJATT, there are no "must know" words.
  You'll learn everything eventually.
* Sometimes you'll see that the same word appears in more than one sub-deck.
  E.g., a word appearing in the `N4` deck and also appearing in the `N2` deck.
  If you know the word already, it's fine to delete or suspend the other card.

## Do I have to finish the entire deck?

I [recommend](basic-vocabulary.html#how-to-study)
that you learn at least 1,000 and up to 2,000 cards
before you start mining your own sentences.
The rest of the deck is supplementary material to assist during sentence mining.

There are more cards in Ankidrone Essentials than needed to complete the beginner stage.
Is it bad? No, I don't think so.
You learn only the cards you want to learn.
Providing more high quality TSCs is better than providing less,
since you can delete the cards you don't like and still be left with a decent amount of TSCs.
Having access to high quality example sentences is important for a language learner.
