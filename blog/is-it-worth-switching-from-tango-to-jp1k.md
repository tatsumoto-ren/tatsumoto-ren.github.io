No.
The [JP1K method](learning-kanji.html#jp1k-method)
was invented so that people can skip RTK
(or any other [isolated kanji](learning-kanji.html#isolated-kanji-study) study deck).
For a lot of people learning kanji out of context is boring and difficult.
The benefit of the JP1K method is that you can start learning
from authentic Japanese sentences almost from the start
instead of spending time on memorizing individual characters.
If you've basically finished the [Tango N5](ankidrone-essentials.html#structure) deck,
it's safe to assume that you've already got enough kanji reading ability
to continue learning vocabulary from native content.
Moreover, [Ankidrone Foundation](jp1k-anki-deck.html) is largely based on Tango N5.
The only thing that's different is the card template.
So there's no point in studying the same material twice.
