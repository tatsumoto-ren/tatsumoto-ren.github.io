The most popular community guideline is 1 hour a day.

You can't directly control how much time you're going to spend on Anki.
The amount of time is determined by what card type (template) you use,
how many new cards you add each day,
your retention ratio,
and how fast you can read Japanese.

If you notice that you overspend you time on Anki,
try TSCs instead of normal sentence cards,
reduce the number of new cards you learn per day,
install [Speed Focus Mode](useful-anki-add-ons-for-japanese.html#speed-focus-mode) Anki add-on.
