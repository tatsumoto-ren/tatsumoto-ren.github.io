*Studying* **anything** is not a requirement for using the [AJATT](whats-ajatt.html) method.
AJATT is about *acquiring* a language through [immersion](whats-immersion.html).
The core idea is that if infants can do it, adults can too.
There is a big difference between acquisition and studying.
Instead of studying,
AJATTers strive to [understand messages](what-is-comprehensible-input.html)
in the target language when they immerse.

If by studying grammar you mean learning from a
[grammar guide](learning-grammar.html#grammar-guides),
we often **recommend** doing it because it optimizes your path to fluency.
It accelerates your progress
and helps remove obstacles along the way.
By learning common grammar patterns early on,
you can significantly improve your comprehension.
