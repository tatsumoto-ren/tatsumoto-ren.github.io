Native speakers absorb language subconsciously through constant exposure,
whereas non-native learners often rely on reading and analyzing sentences
when acquiring their target language.
Premature reading can interfere with
developing a native-like understanding of the language,
and it can harm phonetic awareness and negatively affect your pronunciation.
This article explores how premature reading can limit your ability to internalize phonetics,
and why balancing listening and reading is crucial for mastering any language.

## The Impact of Reading on Perception

Native speakers process language on a subconscious level,
so it's only logical that the best way to learn a language is [through immersion](whats-immersion.html).
When people read, they inevitably analyze the language.
They can go at their own pace, taking time to process and think about every word.
Consequently,
when you learn through reading,
you engage entirely different parts of your brain compared to those of native speakers.
Essentially,
you end up learning not the language itself,
but rather how to translate it into your own mental model,
a sort of *mathematical formula* defined by words and grammatical rules.
Once your brain gets used to understanding language through this analytical lens,
there's no going back.
It's hard to revert to the natural intuitive processing that native speakers use.
At best,
you might be able to train yourself to a point where it becomes automatic,
but the experience will still differ
from the natural perception of a native speaker
who learns to read years after acquiring the language.

## How Spoken and Written Language Differ

Consider, for example, how things are said in English.
In casual speech,
natives often use contractions or altered forms that aren't reflected in their writing.
For instance,
instead of saying "let me," they might say "lemme".
"Going to" often becomes "gonna",
and "want to" might sound like "wanna."
In writing,
native speakers make mistakes that no second-language speaker would make,
such as writing "their" instead of "they're" because they sound alike.

When natives speak,
their speech flows continuously with no clear boundaries between words.
There's no telling where one word ends and another word starts.
Everything is connected.
In contrast,
second-language speakers,
who rely on reading to learn a language,
perceive the language through its written form,
and it influences how they hear and speak it.
When they listen to spoken language,
their brains map what they hear to an internal text-like representation.
Consequently,
when they speak,
their output tends to be segmented,
word-by-word,
with noticeable pauses between words.

These examples illustrate how native pronunciation diverges significantly from the written language
because natives process language differently.
Therefore,
early reading can shape your perception of language in ways
that prevent you from hearing, speaking, and thinking **naturally**.

## The Impact of Reading on Pronunciation

Reading, along with the use of text-based
[flashcards](spaced-repetition.html) and [dictionaries](tag_dictionaries.html),
leads to **subvocalization**.
In other words,
the act of reading activates the muscles in your throat.
If you have not yet developed a solid,
intuitive understanding of the phonetics of your target language (TL) through listening,
your subvocalization during reading will be incorrect and foreign.
This is akin to deliberately practicing poor pronunciation.
Premature reading fosters bad pronunciation habits
and negatively influences how you perceive spoken language.
Undoing these habits later is much more challenging than avoiding them in the first place.
It may take thousands of hours of listening practice,
pronunciation training,
and extensive study of phonetics and [pitch accent](japanese-pitch-accents.html).

## Prioritizing Listening Over Reading

At the beginning of your [AJATT](whats-ajatt.html) journey,
it is advisable to dedicate more time to listening than to reading.
[Passive listening](passive-immersion.html) also counts toward your total listening hours.
When you immerse with voiced text,
such as when watching movies and TV shows with TL subtitles,
it counts as **reading practice**.

While reading might be challenging at first,
getting good at it isn't overly difficult,
and it's never too late to start.
However,
mastering listening and speaking is much harder.
If you become too proficient at reading
while your listening skills lag behind,
your brain will become reading-dominant, which is nearly irreversible.
It cripples you almost permanently.

That said,
learning solely through listening is more difficult and takes longer.
You have to rely exclusively on sound to comprehend meaning.
And this approach is nearly impossible to sell to beginners
who often feel discouraged when they understand nothing during immersion.
Therefore,
in [AJATT](whats-ajatt.html),
we must find a balance between listening and reading.
Reading can speed up progress in acquiring the language and achieving literacy.
However,
over-reliance on reading will have negative impacts
on your [pitch accent](japanese-pitch-accents.html) and speaking skills.

The most challenging decision you'll face
is determining the right balance between listening and reading.
For most learners,
[we recommend](how-much-listening-should-i-do-before-i-start-reading.html)
avoiding reading initially
and instead immersing in media like anime.
Use text-based flashcards and dictionaries
to [learn sentences](sentence-mining.html) you hear while watching.
Once you have established a solid foundation,
you can gradually incorporate reading materials such as manga and novels.
While some adverse effects from reading are inevitable,
they can be mitigated through pronunciation training
and the study of phonetics and pitch accent.

## Final Thoughts

When you're just starting out with a new language,
reading can have negative long-term effects
on your **perception** and **pronunciation** in that language.

* The impact on perception affects the language flow,
  or how quickly and effortlessly you can construct sentences in your head compared to native speakers.
* The impact on pronunciation affects how you sound,
  how your pronunciation differs from that of native speakers.
  When learners rely heavily on written text
  before fully internalizing the language's sound system,
  they develop bad pronunciation.

If you're learning your target language primarily **to enjoy content**,
such as reading light novels or watching anime,
and you don't plan to live in a country where the language is spoken
or speak with native speakers,
you don't need to worry too much about your accent
or the balance between listening and reading.
In this case, feel free to immerse in any content you enjoy.

However,
if you aim for **perfect pronunciation**,
consider delaying reading until you can understand the TL through sound alone.
This approach can help you develop a more native-like linguistic intuition.
