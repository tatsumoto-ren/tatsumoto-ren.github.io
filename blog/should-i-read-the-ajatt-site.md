In my previous article,
"[What's AJATT](whats-ajatt.html),"
I introduced the AJATT method,
which was created by Khatzumoto in 2006.
If you're interested in learning more about Khatzumoto's original ideas,
you may want to read his blog.
It can help answer some of your language learning questions.

Khatzumoto was active from 2006 to 2010,
during which time he wrote a series of articles
that formed the bulk of the original Table Of Contents.
Although the site disappeared from the Internet around 2023,
you can still access the articles on archive.org.

Not everything on the old AJATT site is particularly useful.
Before diving into the archives,
I recommend reading
[the new guide](table-of-contents.html)
to ensure you're familiar with the latest version of the AJATT method.
The method has evolved since Khatzumoto left,
and it's important to be aware of the new approach
before learning about the old ways.

Once you're ready, focus on the
[AJATT Table of Contents](https://web.archive.org/web/20150501215239/http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/all-japanese-all-the-time-ajatt-how-to-learn-japanese-on-your-own-having-fun-and-to-fluency)
and ignore everything outside of it.
I also recommend exploring
[the older version](https://web.archive.org/web/20080828035044/http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/all-japanese-all-the-time-ajatt-how-to-learn-japanese-on-your-own-having-fun-and-to-fluency)
which contains less junk.

The latest available version of the old AJATT blog is a mess.
Although AJATT began as a free blog,
the articles outside the Table Of Contents
are cluttered with ads for Khatzumoto's language learning products.
They are frankly just useless junk of questionable quality.
There are free (and libre) alternatives available.
Therefore, reading only the Table Of Contents should suffice.
