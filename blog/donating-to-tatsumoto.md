I really appreciate you being here.
Because almost all my content is offered free of charge,
this site and the
[Ajatt-Tools](https://github.com/Ajatt-Tools)
project relies on donations and support from its community to stay alive.
We do not have ads or privacy-violating trackers, we are entirely dependent on you.

If this site,
our community
or the free software projects developed at Ajatt-Tools were useful to you,
I'll appreciate if you donate to help me support myself
and continue delivering new guides, tools and resources.
You can support me over at one of the membership platforms or donate cryptocurrency.

## Fundraising

Our project exists solely on the funds of subscribers.
Since 2020, I have been working on AJATT full time.
AJATT cannot be sustainable if I cannot buy food and pay my bills.
Thousands of people visit this site every day.
If even some of them contribute `$1`, it will be a huge help for us!
A small symbolic donation of `$1` or `$5` will not make you poorer,
but will save our common cause!
❤️  Please follow the links below and donate according to your abilities.
Any amount of help is important.
Do not let our common cause fail!

The money you donate primarily goes toward my paycheck for maintaining the website,
paying for hosting and the domain name,
updating and improving existing articles (lessons),
and writing new lessons.
The funds also support work on Ajatt-Tools,
including making, updating, and improving our software toolset,
Anki add-ons, Anki decks, and other resources used with the AJATT method.
If funding is insufficient,
I may have to seek job opportunities elsewhere,
which would slow down the evolution and development of the AJATT method.

Your continued support through donations is crucial to the ongoing progress
and maintenance of this valuable resource for language learners.
A huge thank you to everyone who stays with us!
It is only thanks to you that we are still standing!
