AJATT stands for **All Japanese All The Time**.
It is a method of reaching fluency in Japanese in a relatively short period of time.
It encourages doing as much Japanese as you can every day,
[immersing](whats-immersion.html) yourself in the language and culture of Japan
without having to travel to the country,
take [classes](classes.html),
use outdated and boring [textbooks](are-textbooks-bad.html),
or spend any money.
Essentially,
this means that the shortest path to fluency
is to integrate Japanese into your daily life
with the help of the Internet and modern technology.

The AJATT method primarily involves learning the language
through a combination of reading and listening.
This could include watching Japanese movies and TV shows,
as well as reading Japanese books and manga.
The method emphasizes that **fun** and learning go hand in hand,
that Japanese should not feel like "work" or "study."
Enjoying the learning process is absolutely essential.
If the process is not fun,
one should either stop or figure a way to make it fun.

Key aspects of AJATT include
Stephen Krashen's [Input Hypothesis](what-is-comprehensible-input.html),
the use of [SRS](spaced-repetition.html) to help remember new words and phrases,
learning kanji through the [JP1K](learning-kanji.html#jp1k-method) method,
the focus on [learning sentences](sentence-mining.html) instead of isolated vocabulary and grammar,
and the use of [TSC](discussing-various-card-templates.html#targeted-sentence-cards).

AJATT was also influenced by [Antimoon](https://www.antimoon.com/),
another input-based language learning method.
While Antimoon focuses on learning English,
AJATT mostly revolves around Japanese.
However, the principles can be adapted for learning any language
by replacing the Japanese-specific elements.

AJATT was created by a person named Khatzumoto in 2006.
Following Khatzumoto's retirement in 2023,
Tatsumoto took the reins as his successor
and now governs the guidelines and structure of the AJATT method.
Here on this site
and within [our community](join-our-community.html),
we not only teach the AJATT method,
but also continue to refine and enhance it.
Over the years,
we have developed new ideas that have not been discussed elsewhere
and created tools that make language learning easier.
Our goal is to share AJATT's insights with a broader audience
while consistently updating and improving the method.
As Khatzumoto once said,
AJATT does not remain static.
It is flexible and should evolve.
Therefore,
we are excited to continue his work.
