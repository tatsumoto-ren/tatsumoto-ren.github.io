<blockquote>
<p>There's this lazy idea that somehow if you passively sit around and watch
people using a language this will somehow endow you with the ability to
flexibly produce a language in the same way you see others using it. People
want to believe it because they want to be able to watch TV or play a cell
phone game like Duolingo or valueless Rosetta Stone-like software and somehow
gain competence in a language.</p>
<p>It's not going to happen ever. Learning to play a boring computer game using
words from a different language is not the same as learning to speak the
language.</p>
<p>You might say of &quot;just listening to speech&quot; that &quot;that's what children do,&quot; but
that's not true at all. Children try pretty hard to participate and understand
conversation. They sometimes have a desperate personal need to understand each
passing sentence and hear the language they are trying to learn for hours a day
for years. You watching some forgettable movie in the background as you play
with your phone don't.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>We talk about <a href="whats-immersion.html">input and immersion</a> a lot on this site.
But the most important point to take away is that
the input should be at least somewhat <a href="what-is-comprehensible-input.html">comprehensible</a>
and active attempts should be constantly made
to make the unknown bits more comprehensible.
If you just sit around watching something that you don't understand at all,
don't expect to gain any competence in the language.</p>
<hr>
<p>Some remarks about children: children learn to understand their native language first,
and then learn to speak it.
If you think about it, it's pretty obvious.
If you learn a set of phrases in your target language,
and then have a conversation with a native speaker,
how are you supposed to understand what the person says back to you?
As language learners, we need to practice speaking after we learn to understand.</p>
<p>In his post Luke talks specifically about Duolingo and Rosetta Stone.
They are indeed very ineffective,
but they have nothing to do with <strong>consuming</strong> media.
Instead,
they require active, deliberate yet extremely inefficient <strong>studying</strong>.
We do not recommend apps <a href="why-shouldnt-i-just-keep-using-an-app-instead.html">like Duolingo</a>
as their methodology conflicts
with <a href="whats-ajatt.html">AJATT</a>'s ideas of immersion learning.
These resources base their
instruction around constructing sentences from grammar rules, memorizing
vocabulary in a specific order, and using questionable translations and
low-quality text-to-speech software instead of audio recordings of native speakers.</p>
<p>Duolingo attempts to present itself as a game,
yet those who have tried it know that it is not a very fun game to play.
Duolingo has even implemented a notification system
intended to prompt those who have stopped studying to come back.
AJATT's concept of &quot;consuming media&quot; is different.
It involves
learning by reading, watching, and listening to authentic content in the target language,
without relying on any phone apps.
Anki is likely the only app one may need,
but it is primarily a desktop app,
with the phone version playing a minor role.</p>
<p>Luke also talks about watching TV or a movie in the target language.
That's a completely different activity from using a phone app.
First, I think, not so many people would actually watch a movie they can't understand yet
without trying to make at least some attempts to understand what they're watching.
You are watching a movie in your target language because it's fun, and you want to understand it.
It makes no sense to watch it without trying to understand.
You either watch a movie and try to comprehend it using a wide range of tools available to you,
primarily dictionaries,
or you already understand the movie pretty well,
and you don't need intensive work to make it comprehensible.
In AJATT we call the former <em>intensive</em> immersion, and the latter <em>free-flow</em> immersion.</p>
<p>It sounds like in his post Luke talks about something similar to free-flow immersion.
During free-flow immersion you're paying attention to the content
but don't pause, don't look up words and don't make flashcards.
While it may not be as effective as intensive immersion in terms of learning vocabulary,
it still has a positive effect on one's ability due to the fact that
you can already understand most of the story,
you are paying your full attention,
and you can infer the unknown pieces from the context.
Free-flow immersion is enjoyable and helpful,
especially if you are an intermediate or advanced learner.
However, it's not the only type of immersion you should be doing.
You have to do intensive immersion to improve at your target language,
but at the same time you need to acknowledge
that it's not feasible to sit and do intensive immersion for 12 hours a day.
You get tired of constant pausing and lookups.
Free-flow immersion is a compromise between doing nothing and doing immersion.</p>
<p>AJATT also has passive (background) immersion.
Passive immersion is when you listen to an audio recording in the foreign language
while doing something else.
Passive immersion is less intensive than free-flow immersion,
is done <strong>only</strong> through listening
and involves only partial attention.
While doing passive immersion,
usually you don't look anything up in a dictionary.
<strong>Before</strong> immersing passively in a piece of media,
AJATT recommends that one must first immerse in it actively.
As an example,
you could watch a Japanese movie and read its Japanese transcript (subtitles).
Only then you extract the audio track to play it in the background.
You need to learn the new words and grammar encountered during active immersion,
as this will make it easier to comprehend the same piece when listening passively.
When doing passive immersion,
you're mostly letting what you've already learned sink in.
You're not trying to learn new stuff.
Again, listening to incomprehensible audio is not going to help you.</p>
<p>To summarize, what Luke says is mostly accurate,
but he mixes together activities that are distinct from one another,
and uses terms that have different meanings in the context of immersion learning.
Sometimes he correctly identifies a problem but draws a wrong conclusion.
Phone apps are not effective.
Intensive immersion accompanied by using dictionaries
and looking up words you don't know — works really well.
Watching TV and movies in a free-flow mode is beneficial,
but only when the learner is actively paying attention.
Free-flow immersion becomes more and more effective as your level in the target language grows.
Passively listening — works, but only if the learner has actively immersed themselves in the content before.
Watching or listening to incomprehensible content — doesn't work or works poorly at best.
It is, however, suggested that listening to incomprehensible audio has some positive influence on the ability to discern sounds.</p>
