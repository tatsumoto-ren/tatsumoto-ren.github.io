Slice of life shows.

You can divide the language into domains of interest.
The easiest domains are shows for children, slice of life and romance anime.
Since in TV shows for kids there's often very little dialogue,
and the speech is too simplified,
most people skip them and choose slice of life and romance anime.
Then they slowly advance by selecting other anime genres
until they can consume a wide variety of input and understand it perfectly.

To find easy anime you can search [MAL](https://myanimelist.net/).
Make sure there are as few genres as possible
and exclude other genres to prevent difficult anime from appearing in the results.
Here's an [example search](https://myanimelist.net/anime.php?cat=0&q=&type=1&score=0&status=2&p=0&r=0&sm=0&sd=0&sy=2000&em=0&ed=0&ey=0&c[0]=a&c[1]=b&c[2]=c&c[3]=d&c[4]=e&c[5]=f&c[6]=g&genre_ex[0]=1&genre_ex[1]=2&genre_ex[2]=10&genre_ex[3]=24&genre_ex[4]=37&genre_ex[5]=39&genre_ex[6]=13&genre_ex[7]=62&genre_ex[8]=66&genre_ex[9]=18&genre_ex[10]=67&genre_ex[11]=38&genre_ex[12]=6&genre_ex[13]=68&genre_ex[14]=40&genre_ex[15]=3&genre_ex[16]=21&genre_ex[17]=29&genre_ex[18]=78&genre_ex[19]=32&genre[0]=4&genre[1]=36&o=3&w=1).
