I watch anime almost every day.

Watching anime is a great way to learn Japanese.
Most people who want to learn Japanese love anime.
Anime is easy to download,
and you can watch it with Japanese subtitles if you don't understand something.
Plus,
if you watch ongoings,
every week you have to show up for the next episode,
which keeps you engaged,
you don't lose your momentum or motivation.

However,
the dialogue in anime is often intentionally unrealistic.
To truly appreciate just how unrealistic it can be,
you need a deep understanding of natural, everyday Japanese.
Ironically,
if you rely solely on anime to learn Japanese,
you might not be able to appreciate anime to its fullest potential.
It's important to immerse yourself in other types of media as well.
