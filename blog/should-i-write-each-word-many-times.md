Write each word once.
You just need to write a word correctly with the correct stroke order.

The goal is to test whether you can recall how to write something from memory.
For example,
if you were to go to Japan and needed to write by hand, you'd want to be prepared.
Although writing a word multiple times in a row might help a little,
the real benefits come from [spaced repetition](spaced-repetition.html).
Waiting before trying to recall a word again is more effective,
which is why [Anki](setting-up-anki.html) has learning steps.
Anki takes care of the intervals for you,
and if you forget how to write a word,
the program will show you the corresponding flashcard more often.

For learning handwriting, see [Writing TSCs](writing-japanese.html#writing-kanji).
