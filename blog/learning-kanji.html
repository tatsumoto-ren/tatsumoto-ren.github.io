<p>Unlike kana which you can learn in a matter of few days no matter what method you pick,
learning kanji is apparently more difficult, and there are many methods of doing it.</p>

<p>To pick the right method
you have to understand why you want to learn kanji in the first place.
The &quot;practice how you play&quot; principle applies here as well.
Kanji do not exist in a vacuum, instead people use them to write Japanese words.
In order to &quot;learn&quot; them all you need to do is learn words.
The only time you ever need to do anything with kanji is
when you are either reading a word or writing a word.
So, as long as you can read and write words, your kanji problems are solved.</p>
<p>To learn a word means to memorize how it's read and what it means.
Over time as you keep learning words,
you unconsciously get better at recognizing the kanji.</p>
<p>We advise against learning kanji readings in isolation.
Very often a kanji character has a number of completely different readings.
Not only learning all of them is an enormous task,
but it's impossible to apply the knowledge to real native content when reading.</p>
<p>It is glaringly obvious,
but people who have been exposed to Japanese textbooks
and traditional language learning in general
are trapped by Dogma and have simply never actually thought it through.</p>

<p>To someone who hasn't started learning Japanese yet,
kanji may look like blobs of random scribbles.
Thankfully, in reality each kanji is just a composition
of either simpler kanji or primitive components called radicals.
For example, <code>曇</code> is a combination of <code>日</code>, <code>雨</code> and <code>云</code>.
There are only about 200 of such basic components.</p>
<p>This property of kanji can be and often used to aid memorization.
Many kanji study methods exploit kanji composition and teach kanji in terms of their parts.
Being able to see kanji in terms of their components makes learning words easier.</p>

<p>Some methods insist that you learn to write kanji from the start.
Due to the effort it takes we don't think it's a fair use of your time.
Japanese typing is done phonetically,
so as long as you can read kanji, you can type kanji as well.
Instead, we recommend waiting until you're fluent and
<a href="writing-japanese.html">learn handwriting</a> then.
Learning to produce characters that you've already learned to recognize is going to be easier.</p>
<p>It's not a surprise that in Japan handwriting is still important.
But if you don't plan to live in Japan,
we think it's perfectly reasonable to
never learn how to write out kanji by hand.</p>
<h2 id="kanji-fluency"><a class="anchor" href="#kanji-fluency" title="Permanent link"><svg aria-hidden="true" class="aal_svg" height="16" version="1.1" viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"></path></svg></a>Kanji fluency</h2>
<p>Jumping right into learning words in the beginning is not easy.
Similar characters often look the same
and remembering words takes many repetitions.
You have to somehow force the words into your brain
and there are no mental anchors to help you.
However, if you do this enough eventually you arrive at the point when kanji stop being foreign anymore.
Once you reach this point, your brain starts to recognize each kanji as a whole
without paying attention to its component parts.
You start distinguishing them easily from each other,
and learning new kanji becomes effortless.
This point is called <strong>kanji fluency</strong>.</p>
<p>When you reach kanji fluency,
recognizing a kanji becomes just like recognizing someone's face.
It takes an instant to remember the face of a person.
Later if you just look at the person again
you immediately know if you've met them before
even if you might forget their name or why you know them.</p>
<p>With kanji, you're not analyzing the component parts
but taking the whole character as one unit.
When you see a new kanji, it will look like <em>something</em> to you.
When you encounter that character again,
you will instantly recognize it as the same exact character.</p>

<p>I'm going to present two main methods of learning kanji that I think are the most effective.
One is isolated kanji study, the other is JP1K.
Isolated kanji study is when you learn meanings of one or two thousand
most common or most useful individual kanji characters in a span of a couple of months.
Knowing the meanings later aids in memorization of words.
JP1K is a method that was invented in the Japanese learning community quite recently.
It consists of learning the most common 1,000 words
with a trick that makes memorizing kanji readings easier.</p>
<h2 id="isolated-kanji-study"><a class="anchor" href="#isolated-kanji-study" title="Permanent link"><svg aria-hidden="true" class="aal_svg" height="16" version="1.1" viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"></path></svg></a>Isolated kanji study</h2>
<p>Training kanji recognition through isolated kanji study
can be used as a ladder to help you achieve kanji fluency
and to make moving on to learning vocabulary less of a burden.
You start by learning meanings of individual kanji.
By doing so you create mental anchors in your brain
which help you associate words with the kanji.
Kanji are learned by breaking them up into their components
and viewing each kanji as a combination of its parts.
The method uses short stories or images called mnemonics.
Each story ties the components together to make kanji easy to remember.</p>
<p>You memorize 1000-2000 characters this way,
and then you end up naturally reaching the point of kanji fluency.
The main goal of isolated kanji study is not to learn what every kanji means,
but simply to push learners to the point
where recognizing a kanji feels similar to recognizing a human face.</p>
<p>Now, another way to look at this is
if we watch Chinese people who learn Japanese,
they improve so much faster and reach higher levels
than traditional western learners of the language
because they know the characters already.
So you first need to become like a Chinese person.
Chinese people don't know how to read the kanji in Japanese,
but they know how kanji look like,
and they know the meanings.
After you catch up to a Chinese person
then you can move on to learning grammar and sentences.</p>
<p>Many commonly used resources that encourage mnemonics are based on RTK.
Originally, RTK refers to a book &quot;Remembering the Kanji&quot; by James Heisig.
The ordering of characters in the book
and its component-based mnemonic system
are used in combination with the SRS.</p>
<p>Kanji in the book are ordered by the complexity and number of their components.
So for example before you learn <code>拐</code>, you have to learn <code>手</code>, <code>口</code> and <code>刀</code>.
Every character is given only one meaning (keyword) to avoid memory interference.
If you're interested in learning more about the logic behind RTK,
read the introduction at the beginning of the
<a href="https://midov.pl/_matrix/media/r0/download/midov.pl/PQuWVvjTjvQkBXuuOPYmqJDn">RTK part 1 book</a>.</p>
<p>Remembering the Kanji
only orders kanji in terms of their components and gives mnemonics for some of them.
Fortunately, there are many Anki decks created from RTK.
They free you from the need to copy the kanji from the book into Anki by hand,
preserve the ordering and mnemonic system,
and add the benefits of spaced repetition.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://disk.yandex.com/d/QRMVEsUtbItLyA">RRTK</a>.
Recognition RTK.
It is an Anki deck intended to optimize RTK for training recognition.
Compared to the original book,
the number of characters was reduced to the most common 1,000 kanji.
The reason for this is that the main goal of RRTK is not to learn what every kanji means,
but simply to bring learners to the point of kanji fluency.
Kanji are given on the front of the cards,
and you need to memorize the meanings they represent.
The format of the flashcards is similar to
<a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/lazy-kanji-cards-a-new-srs-card-format/">Lazy Kanji</a>,
which is a card format Khatzumoto from AJATT recommended.</li>
<li>AnkiWeb has a <a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/decks/rtk">large collection</a> of premade RTK decks.</li>
</ul>
<p>Other options that use the mnemonic-based approach but are not based on RTK:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.kanjidamage.com/">KanjiDamage</a>.
A big improvement over RTK.
Similarly to RTK, kanji are broken up into their components,
but the components themselves are different from RTK.
They have clever names invented to facilitate the memorization process.
While RTK gives mnemonic stories for some kanji,
KanjiDamage has them for every kanji.
The mnemonics are usually pretty great.
There's also a mnemonic for the most important reading, usually
<abbr title="on'yomi, Chinese-derived reading of a kanji">音読み</abbr>.</li>
<li><a href="https://mega.nz/#!CQg0SKyI!Ufho0RKmmW8P6XRx8KiDY1JeAXoGOgmjrEscayil8cA">KanjiDamage Plus</a>.
A slightly larger version of KanjiDamage which contains ~200 additional kanji.
Some component names were renamed.
See <a href="https://kanjidamageplus.neocities.org/">the online reference</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The downside is that although this method makes it easier to remember words later on,
it requires investing time into essentially memorizing English keywords
that have a very loose connection to real Japanese.
KanjiDamage gives you a little more benefit
by incorporating the main reading of each kanji into the mnemonic story.
Knowing the most common reading helps you trigger your memory
as you take your first steps in reading native Japanese.</p>

<p>The method is aimed at complete beginners who don't want to go through RTK
but feel intimidated by the idea of learning whole words from the start.
JP1K is intended to be a compromise between the two.</p>
<p>To execute it you need an Anki deck formatted in a specific way.
On the front of each card you have a word, phrase or sentence in Japanese language
written in full kanji and without furigana but if you hover over it
then the furigana readings will appear.
On the back you have everything necessary to understand the flashcard,
which may include English translations, dictionary definitions and native audio.</p>
<p>The important part is how you review the deck:</p>
<ol>
<li>A flashcard comes up, furigana is hidden.</li>
<li>Read the target word, or the whole sentence if you want.</li>
<li>If the word contains kanji try to recall its reading.
Then hover over the word to make the furigana pop up
and see if you've recalled the reading correctly.</li>
<li>Try to recall the meaning of the target word. It doesn't need to be precise.</li>
<li>Reveal the back side of the card and see if the meaning was correct.</li>
<li>When grading yourself, pass the card if you understand the meaning.
Whether you remembered the reading or not doesn't matter.
Avoid &quot;Hard&quot; and &quot;Easy&quot; buttons.</li>
</ol>
<p>This way when you review a card you may completely forget the reading,
but then if you get the meaning right you still pass the card.</p>
<p>The idea here is that this will make the process of going through the deck
much more enjoyable because all you have to do is remember the meaning
to pass the card. It's not that hard.
The advantage over isolated kanji study
is that you're going to start noticing
the new words you've learned in your immersion.</p>
<p>This should be enough to eventually achieve kanji fluency
because every time you're still trying to recall the reading,
you're just not taking it into account when grading yourself.
On the other hand, if you could see the reading immediately
then there would be no deliberate practice involved,
so you'd eventually start ignoring the kanji.</p>

<p>I often see people asking,
&quot;should I learn radicals? Is it worth studying kanji radicals?&quot;</p>
<p>If you're taking an isolated kanji study approach,
you will be learning radicals and kanji composition with the Anki deck you have downloaded.
For example, KanjiDamage introduces a new radical or kanji part before all the kanji that use it.
RTK does the same.
There's no need to study radicals separately.</p>
<p>If you're doing the JP1K method,
radicals are skipped altogether.
The method is designed to teach kanji like pictures.
You memorize kanji by simply seeing them many times.</p>
<p>So the answer is &quot;no&quot;.</p>

<p>There are three paths you can take:</p>
<ol>
<li>Learning words from the start.
This is going to be a little difficult at first,
but all of us learn this way past the beginner stage.</li>
<li>Study kanji in isolation using a mnemonic-based method such as KanjiDamage or RTK.
For each kanji you memorize its meaning
which later acts like a mental anchor making associating words with kanji easier.
Out of the available options my favorite one is KanjiDamage Plus.</li>
<li>Use the JP1K method to learn words without penalizing yourself for not knowing their readings.</li>
</ol>
<p>The last two paths only serve as intermediate steps to prepare you for reading native content.
Any of them should take about a month or two to complete.</p>
<p>Either path will result in success

<p>There are 3 RTK books total.</p>
<ol>
<li>Teaches how to write ~2000 kanji.
The list of kanji taught roughly matches the <code>常用漢字</code> list.</li>
<li>Teaches readings of kanji introduced in the first book.</li>
<li>Teaches how to write additional ~1000 kanji.
The list of kanji taught roughly matches the <code>人名用漢字</code> list.</li>
</ol>
<p>For the purpose of training kanji recognition and reaching the point of kanji fluency
it is sufficient to learn only ~1000 kanji from the first book,
which is exactly what RRTK does.
As mentioned before, learning how to write them is not recommended.
The second book is not needed either,
kanji readings should be learned in context.</p>

<p>If you go with any isolated kanji deck,
you will notice that after completing it
the retention rate of the deck will start to decline.
This happens to almost everyone.
After you finish the deck,
you still remember most of the kanji,
but after several months the retention rate plummets to 45-50%.</p>
<p>Once the retention rate starts to decline,
it's time to delete the deck.
By the time it happens,
you can already read some Japanese
and don't need to rely on English keywords to recognize kanji.</p>
<p>To avoid quickly forgetting most of the kanji you learned
before you have a chance to develop reading ability,
continue reviewing for 3 to 6 months after completing the deck.</p>
<p>The problem with retention when learning kanji in isolatoin
is one of the reasons why the JP1K method was created.</p>
