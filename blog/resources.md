## Examples and pronunciations

Sometimes you might find yourself in a situation where
you want to add a word to your SRS
but the example sentence you've found the word in is too complicated,
or you've lost it because you forgot to save it.
In such cases sites with example sentences come to rescue.

* [Massif](https://massif.la/ja).
  Allows you to search over 30 million unique Japanese sentences.
* [Sentence Search](https://sentencesearch.neocities.org/).

## Immersion material

Don't use streaming sites and sites for reading manga online if possible.
Always download what you consume.
Storing immersion material locally makes mining substantially easier.

### Torrent trackers

A [torrent](https://wikiless.org/wiki/BitTorrent)
tracker is a site that hosts user-uploaded
[torrent files](https://wikiless.org/wiki/Torrent_file).
To download something (like an anime) using torrents
you usually download a torrent file and open it with a torrent client.
The torrent client then downloads the actual content.
Before using the torrent sites, [choose a torrent client](#torrent-clients).

* [Nyaa](https://nyaa.si/).
  A torrent site with anime, manga, light novels and Japanese dramas.
  Contains 98% of what you need to actually learn Japanese.

  Unfortunately, Nyaa is blocked in some countries.
  Accessing it through Tor can be difficult due to DDOS protection.
  If you can't access the site, use a mirror.

  Available mirrors:

  1) [Nyaa ISS](https://nyaa.iss.ink/).
  1) [Nyaa Land](https://nyaa.land/).
* [Tokyo Toshokan](https://www.tokyotosho.info/).
  A BitTorrent library for Japanese media.
* [Rutracker](https://rutracker.org/).
  Another torrent site.
  Has lots of Japanese movies, dramas and anime.
  Ongoing anime gets uploaded with a noticeable delay.
  Refer to Nyaa first if you watch ongoings.

  This site can be accessed through Tor.
* [Animebytes](https://animebytes.tv/).
  A private tracker. Offers content similar to what you find on Nyaa ISS.
* [AvistaZ](https://avistaz.to/).
  A private tracker for Asian movies and TV-shows.

  Asian private tracker for Movies only.

  A private tracker for Japanese content only.
* [JPTV.CLUB](https://jptv.club/).
  Another private tracker.
  You can join if you have accounts on other private trackers.
  Here you can find Japanese TV programs.
  Most uploads contain Japanese subs straight from the broadcast.
  It's nice to have them for mining sentences.
* [anisource](https://asnet.pw/).
  An aggregate site for high quality raws from Raws-4U, スカー Raws and Leopard-Raws.
* **[Private trackers](https://wiki.installgentoo.com/wiki/Private_trackers)**.
  Everything else I didn't mention.

  You can switch channels in mpv by pressing `<` and `>`.
* [News24.jp](https://www.news24.jp/).
  Lets you watch a live stream with news,
  but you have to allow to run an obscene amount of nonfree JavaScript code.
  To avoid running nonfree JS,
  [watch the stream in `mpv`](https://github.com/tatsumoto-ren/dotfiles/blob/main/.local/share/applications/news24.desktop)
  by creating a desktop shortcut.
* [keylabo](https://www.keylabo.com/watch-tv-online-for-free/).
  Similarly to News24, lists a number of channels you can watch online.
  Unfortunately, not all of them can be opened in mpv.

### YouTube with subtitles

to safely watch YouTube videos via [Invidious](https://github.com/iv-org/invidious).

### TikTok

You can watch videos from TikTok via [ProxiTok](https://github.com/pablouser1/ProxiTok).
Browser add-ons like `LibRedirect` can automatically redirect
from `tiktok.com` to a chosen `ProxiTok` instance.

Find Japanese videos by tags, for example:

  but you can also get it [from the AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/librewolf/).

  Additionally, there's [pyllyukko user.js](https://github.com/pyllyukko/user.js)

  Press a configured keyboard shortcut
  and select the portion of the manga page to convert.

  and set "Default font" to your Japanese font of choice
  to avoid [Chinese](japanese-fonts.html#chinese-glyphs) fallbacks.
  [Yu Mincho](https://disk.yandex.com/d/cj0hetiqGjhDiA/Yu%20Mincho) worked for me.
  Japanese `Noto` fonts did not, some text was still in Chinese.
  On the "Page" tab you can choose View Mode.

  On the "Window" tab
  you can tell the program to apply your [kvantum](setting-up-anki.html#kvantum) theme.
  crqt-ng can automatically copy selected text to the clipboard,
  which is handy when using [Yomichan Search](what-is-yomichan-search.html).
  To enable the feature, under the "Window" tab check "automatically copy when selected."

  and "When multiple words are selected" to "Copy".
  This should be enough to comfortably use Foliate with
  [Yomichan Search](what-is-yomichan-search.html).
  Change Layout to "Scrolled" in Advanced section of the menu
  to prevent lags and ensure a consistent layout.

  Use keyboard shortcuts, "n" to go to the next page and "p" to go to the previous page.
  To scroll without the mouse, press "j" and "k".
* [KOreader](https://koreader.rocks/).

  converting them to the `StarDict` format
  with [PyGlossary](https://github.com/ilius/pyglossary).
  The dictionaries should be placed in `~/.config/koreader/data/dict` if you're on GNU/Linux.

  Under "Font" check "Enable system fonts" (the checkbox is at the beginning of the font list)
  to have access to your [Japanese fonts](japanese-fonts.html).
  Then in document settings set the font to `Noto Serif CJK JP` or a similar Japanese font.

  If you want to create Anki cards, install [Anki plugin for KOreader](https://github.com/Ajatt-Tools/anki.koplugin).
* [Zathura](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Zathura).
