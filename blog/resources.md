## Immersion material

Don't use streaming sites and sites for reading manga online if possible.
Always download what you consume.
Storing immersion material locally makes mining substantially easier.

Can't decide what to immerse in?
Explore [Japanese Media Recommendations](https://ixrec.neocities.org/immersion/).

### Torrent trackers

A [torrent](https://wikiless.org/wiki/BitTorrent)
tracker is a site that hosts user-uploaded
[torrent files](https://wikiless.org/wiki/Torrent_file).
To download something (like an anime) using torrents
you usually download a torrent file and open it with a torrent client.
The torrent client then downloads the actual content.
Before using the torrent sites, [choose a torrent client](#torrent-clients).

* [Nyaa](https://nyaa.si/).
  A torrent site with anime, manga, light novels and Japanese dramas.
  Contains 98% of what you need to actually learn Japanese.

  Unfortunately, Nyaa is blocked in some countries.

  If you can't access the site, use a mirror.

  Available mirrors:

  It's nice to have them for mining sentences.
* [anisource](https://asnet.pw/).
  An aggregate site for high quality raws from Raws-4U, スカー Raws and Leopard-Raws.

  Change Layout to "Scrolled" in Advanced section of the menu
  to prevent lags and ensure a consistent layout.

  Use keyboard shortcuts, "n" to go to the next page and "p" to go to the previous page.

  Under "Font" check "Enable system fonts" (the checkbox is at the beginning of the font list)
  to have access to your [Japanese fonts](japanese-fonts.html).
