Yomichan Search is a dictionary search tool
that can be used in the web browser.
It lets you use Yomichan similarly to
[Qolibri](setting-up-qolibri.html),
but in addition it can parse and analyze entire sentences.

[Install Yomichan](setting-up-yomichan.html) if you haven't already.
After you set it up,
you can access Yomichan Search by pressing <kbd>Alt+Insert</kbd>
or by clicking
![yomichan-settings](https://foosoft.net/projects/yomichan/ext/images/yomichan-icon.svg)
on the toolbar and pressing "Search".

It has a clipboard monitor which is something I use all the time.
When enabled, it listens for changes in the system clipboard
and automatically pastes text from the clipboard to the search page.
[Mpvacious](mining-from-movies-and-tv-shows.html#mpvacious)
was made to be paired together with Yomichan Search.
Yomichan Search is also quite handy
when [mining from manga](mining-from-manga.html) and reading books.

Alternatives to Yomichan Search are:
* Qolibri's [Watch clipboard](setting-up-qolibri.html#watch-clipboard) button.
* [GoldenDict](setting-up-goldendict.html)'s "Enable Scanning" button.
