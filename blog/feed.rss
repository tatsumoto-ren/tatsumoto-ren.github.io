<title>I Stopped Using Matrix</title>
<author>Tatsumoto Ren</author>
<description><![CDATA[<p>I have some exciting news, folks!
You've been asking me to do this for a long time,
and now the moment has finally arrived.
I've decided to discontinue our Matrix community
in favor of a different platform.</p>

<title>How much time should I spend studying basic grammar each day?</title>
<author>Tatsumoto Ren</author>
<description><![CDATA[<p>It's up to you,
but we recommend spending around 15 to 30 minutes each day on <a href="learning-grammar.html">grammar</a>.
We all know that reading about grammar isn't exactly the most exciting thing in the world.
Thus,
we think that consuming grammar theory <strong>incrementally</strong> over time
will make it easier to consolidate and integrate what you've learned.</p>
<p>If you choose to spend about 30 minutes a day studying grammar,
it's perfectly fine to study basic grammar alongside
<a href="jp1k-anki-deck.html">Ankidrone Foundation</a>
and/or
<a href="ankidrone-essentials.html">Ankidrone Essentials</a>.</p>

<title>Is watching anime with JP subtitles considered as reading?</title>
<author>Tatsumoto Ren</author>
<description><![CDATA[<p>Yes, it is.
Watching anime with
<a href="mining-from-movies-and-tv-shows.html#obtain-subtitles">Japanese subtitles</a>
counts as reading immersion
because reading the subtitles creates an inner voice
that competes with the spoken language that you're listening to.
As a result,
you are not fully paying attention to the native speech.
Instead,
you focus on your internal subvocalization while reading the subtitles.</p>
<p>If you watched anime with English subtitles before starting to learn Japanese,
you've likely spent thousands of hours listening to native Japanese.
However,
if reading subtitles did not interfere with your listening practice,
you would have already learned the language.
This is why we say that watching with subtitles counts as reading immersion.
When you read subtitles,
your own subvocalization interferes with and overshadows the audio.
Consequently,
you end up learning the language of the subtitles
rather than the language of the audio.
In this case, the language of the English fansubs.</p>
<p>Watching anime with Japanese subtitles can help you notice and learn more words,
but it will cause your listening skills to
<a href="is-it-harmful-to-always-have-tl-subtitles-on.html">lag behind</a>.
Relying too heavily on subtitles can create a crutch,
making it difficult to transition to listening without any text support.
If you've spent a long time watching anime with Japanese subtitles
and neglected listening practice,
you will be frustrated when you decide to turn off the subs and watch raw anime.
While you can improve your listening skills by going cold turkey
and immersing with a lot of raw anime,
it will be challenging at first.
It's better to
<a href="how-do-you-recommend-starting-on-listening-practice.html">train your listening ability</a>
while you're still a beginner.
Therefore,
AJATT recommends prioritizing listening to avoid this issue.</p>
<p>We recommend disabling subtitles if you don't need them.
For those who need them,
enable them only when you don't understand something.
Keeping them visible creates a hindrance,
and you can't help but read the subs even if it's unintentional.
It's <a href="en-and-ja-subs-at-the-same-time.html">difficult to ignore</a> them completely.</p>
<p>So,
regardless of your current skill level,
when we <a href="how-should-i-divide-my-study-time.html">divide our study time</a>,
watching something with TL subs counts toward your reading time.</p>

<title>Can't I just read a textbook? Are textbooks inherently bad?</title>
<author>Tatsumoto Ren</author>
<description><![CDATA[<p>If you seriously want to master your target language,
textbooks are not for you.
We recommend skipping them entirely and learning the language through immersion.</p>

<title>What is the difference between the Foundation and Essential decks besides the way the cards are reviewed?</title>
<author>Tatsumoto Ren</author>
<description><![CDATA[<p><a href="ankidrone-essentials.html">Ankidrone Essentials</a>
consists solely of cards from the JLPT Tango textbooks,
maintaining the original order and content.
The deck is designed for those who have completed Ankidrone Foundation
or wish to expand their vocabulary
and supplement <a href="sentence-mining.html">sentence mining</a>.</p>
<p>In contrast,
<a href="jp1k-anki-deck.html">Ankidrone Foundation</a>
takes the N5 subdeck from Ankidrone Essentials,
but the card order is rearranged.
We tried to arrange the cards so that each new card is <a href="one-target-sentences.html">1T</a>.
The sorting algorithm we used prefers cards
with the fewest estimated number of unknown words per example sentence
and puts them in the beginning of the deck.
The deck is intended for complete beginners who only know hiragana and katakana.
The <a href="learning-kanji.html#jp1k-method">JP1K method</a>
helps new learners get used to reading words with kanji characters
which can initially seem difficult.</p>
<p>Additionally,
many katakana words and place names have been removed from Ankidrone Foundation,
as they are typically unnecessary for learners.
For instance,
words like <code>コンサート</code> are straightforward since they are borrowed from English.
On the other hand,
Ankidrone Essentials includes these terms because they appear in the Tango textbooks.</p>
<p>We also introduced new cards into Ankidrone Foundation
when we saw that certain words needed to be learned before others to preserve the 1T order.</p>
<p>If you decide to skip Ankidrone Foundation
and jump straight into Ankidrone Essentials,
you will need to learn kanji and their readings from the beginning,
which can be more challenging compared to following the JP1K method.
However, this is a choice some learners prefer.
You will also need to suspend or delete any cards you already know,
as Ankidrone Essentials retains all content from the Tango textbooks.
And since Ankidrone Essentials does not maintain the 1T order
as effectively as Ankidrone Foundation,
you may encounter more unfamiliar words within sentences.
However,
it's worth noting that the Foundation deck is not flawless in this regard either.</p>
<p>If you have completed Ankidrone Foundation,
skip the Tango N5 subdeck in Ankidrone Essentials,
as they cover similar vocabulary,
differing mainly in card templates and order.</p>

<title>Learning Kanji Radicals</title>
<author>Tatsumoto Ren</author>
<description><![CDATA[<p>In my previous article on <a href="learning-kanji.html">Learning Kanji</a>,
I mentioned that beginners do not need to
<a href="learning-kanji.html#learning-radicals">learn kanji radicals</a>.
However,
radicals play a significant role in the Japanese language.
Understanding the proper Japanese names for common radicals
aids in grasping spoken conversations about kanji.</p>
<p>The advice provided in this article is tailored for people
who already understand Japanese.
If you are still a beginner,
I recommend focusing on <a href="table-of-contents.html">more essential aspects</a> of Japanese learning.</p>
