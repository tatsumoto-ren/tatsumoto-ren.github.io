<author>Tatsumoto Ren</author>
<description><![CDATA[<p>The most important part of learning Japanese with the

and be able to grow your understanding of the language entirely through immersion
by picking up new words from the media you read, watch or listen to.
To transition towards learning directly from Japanese media,
first you need to level up your comprehension.</p>

<title>Learning Kanji Radicals</title>
<author>Tatsumoto Ren</author>
<description><![CDATA[<p>In my previous article on <a href="learning-kanji.html">Learning Kanji</a>,
I mentioned that beginners do not need to
<a href="learning-kanji.html#learning-radicals">learn kanji radicals</a>.
However,
radicals play a significant role in the Japanese language.
Understanding the proper Japanese names for common radicals
aids in grasping spoken conversations about kanji.</p>
<p>The advice provided in this article is tailored for people
who already understand Japanese.
If you are still a beginner,
I recommend focusing on <a href="table-of-contents.html">more essential aspects</a> of Japanese learning.</p>

<title>Is it best to make the monolingual transition as soon as possible?</title>
<author>Tatsumoto Ren</author>
<description><![CDATA[<p>No.</p>
<p>There's a <a href="going-monolingual.html#when-to-go-monolingual">sweet spot</a>
for making the monolingual transition,
and doing it either too early or too late can reduce your efficiency.
In theory,
you could attempt to go monolingual very early in your learning journey.
You might learn just the most common 50 <a href="basic-vocabulary.html">words</a>,
the bare minimum of <a href="learning-grammar.html">grammar</a>,
and dive into using only the target language for definitions.
It would be very challenging, but it's not impossible.
I've seen people who went monolingual much sooner than I advise.
It was tough for them.
Although they struggled and were often lost,
barely understanding anything for a long time,
they eventually found their way.</p>
<p>So yes,
an early transition is possible.
However,
going monolingual too soon is not the most effective approach.
The difficulty is so high
that you might end up spending an excessive amount of time
doing <a href="going-monolingual.html#looking-up-unknown-words">recursive lookups</a>
and deciphering complex explanations in the monolingual dictionary,
which is not the best use of your time.</p>
<p>If the process is too difficult,
you'll likely spend more time lost in the dictionary than actually learning.
A more balanced approach is to expand your vocabulary
with the help of bilingual dictionaries first.
Then,
transition to monolingual dictionaries when you're more prepared.
This strategy allows for a smoother shift and sets you up for success.</p>

<title>Cross Profile Search And Import</title>
<author>Tatsumoto Ren</author>
<description><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1772763629">Cross Profile Search and Import</a> add-on
is a tool that helps you maintain a neat,
uncluttered main profile while still having access to an extensive sentence bank.
This tool allows you to store your sentence bank
in a separate profile which is not synchronized with AnkiWeb,
and then easily search and import cards into your main profile when required.
In doing so,
it keeps your main profile tidy
while sparing AnkiWeb servers from hefty media uploads.</p>
