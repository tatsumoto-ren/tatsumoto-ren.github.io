## Beginner dictionaries

For beginners,
Rikaitan provides a set of basic bilingual dictionaries.
Learners can use these for the first few months,
then delete them after [going monolingual](going-monolingual.html) (covered later).
To enable Rikaitan lookups, you must download and import at least one dictionary.

<summary>Downloads</summary>

- JMdict (English).
  JMdict is the most common Japanese–English dictionary for beginners.
  - [JMdict_english.zip](https://github.com/Ajatt-Tools/jmdict-rikaitan/releases/latest/download/JMdict_english.zip).
    This is the JMdict but without example sentences.
  - [JMdict_english_with_examples.zip](https://github.com/Ajatt-Tools/jmdict-rikaitan/releases/latest/download/JMdict_english_with_examples.zip).
    This is the version of JMdict with example sentences from the [Tatoeba Project](http://tatoeba.org/home).
    Note that Tatoeba doesn't always have correct example sentences.
- JMdict (Other Languages).
  Non-English JMdict files have fewer entries than the English version.
  Even if your native language is not English,
  Consider importing English too for better coverage.

  regular JMdict.

## Don't import all Rikaitan dictionaries

You need multiple dictionaries because Japanese-Japanese dictionaries have gaps.
Some words appear only in specific dictionaries.

**A few examples:**
* `夢海鼠` is only in `日本国語大辞典`.
* `禿同` is only in `実用日本語表現辞典`.

Though you might think that using every dictionary in Rikaitan is a good idea
and load up all of them,
I would advise you not to do so.
Sometimes the word that you're trying to look up
isn't the one that comes up first in the dictionary.
If you want to find it, you have to scroll down.
And if you have many dictionaries imported,
this is going to be pretty annoying.

Each installed dictionary enlarges Rikaitan's database
and can add several GiB to disk usage.

So I recommend you
keep as few dictionaries in Rikaitan as possible
and use Qolibri or GoldenDict for words you can't find.

## Custom CSS for images

If you want to use `デジタル大辞泉` or `旺文社国語辞典`,
images may render incorrectly
unless you append the following rules to your Popup CSS.
If this happens, go to Rikaitan settings > "Appearance" > "Configure custom CSS...".

<details>
<summary>Popup CSS for images</summary>

```css
.gloss-image-description {
    text-align: center;
}

.definition-item-content,
.gloss-image-link {
    max-width: 100%;
}

.gloss-image-container {
    background: none !important;
}

.gloss-image-link[data-has-aspect-ratio="true"] .gloss-image {
    position: static;
    max-height: 200px;
}

.gloss-image-link[data-has-aspect-ratio="true"] .gloss-image-aspect-ratio-sizer {
    display: none;
}

.gloss-image-container-overlay {
    display: none;
}

img {
    will-change: transform;
}
```

## Custom CSS for Kanji Dictionaries

Rikaitan's kanji dictionary viewer contains a lot of redundant information,
such as duplicated tags, stroke order diagrams, and empty table rows for each entry.
To make the kanji entries more concise when using multiple kanji dictionaries,
you can add some CSS rules.

In "Settings" > "Popup Appearance" > "Configure custom CSS..."
paste the following CSS to condense displayed entries.

<details>
<summary>CSS for kanji</summary>

```css
/* remove misc dict classifications/codepoints/stats */
.kanji-glyph-data > tbody > tr:nth-child(n + 3) {
  display: none;
}

/* remove stroke diagram, freq, header for next entries */
div.entry[data-type='kanji']:nth-child(n + 2) .kanji-glyph-container,
div.entry[data-type='kanji']:nth-child(n + 2) [data-section-type='frequencies'],
div.entry[data-type='kanji']:nth-child(n + 2) table.kanji-glyph-data > tbody > tr:first-child {
  display: none;
}

/* remove 'No data found' */
.kanji-info-table-item-value-empty {
  display: none;
}

/* reduce extra padding */
.kanji-glyph-data,
div.entry[data-type='kanji'],
div.entry[data-type='kanji']:nth-child(n + 2) .kanji-glyph-data > tbody > tr > *,
.kanji-glyph-data dl.kanji-readings-japanese,
div.entry[data-type='kanji']:nth-child(n + 2)
  .kanji-glyph-data
  dl.kanji-readings-chinese[data-count='0'] {
  padding-top: 0 !important;
  padding-bottom: 0 !important;
  margin-bottom: 0em;
  margin-top: 0 !important;
}

/* remove horizontal lines */
.entry + .entry[data-type='kanji'],
div#dictionary-entries > div.entry:nth-child(n + 2) .kanji-glyph-data > tbody > tr > * {
  border-top: none !important;
}

/* change decimal list */
.kanji-gloss-list {
  list-style-type: circle;
