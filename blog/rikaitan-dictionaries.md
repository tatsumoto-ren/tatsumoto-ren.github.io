## Beginner dictionaries

For beginners Rikaitan provides a set of basic bilingual dictionaries.
Leaners can use these dictionaries for the first few months of learning Japanese.
We recommend deleting them after [going monolingual](going-monolingual.html) (covered later).
You must download and import the dictionaries you wish to use
in order to enable Rikaitan definition lookups.

- JMdict (English).
  JMdict is the most common Japanese-English dictionary for beginners.
  - [JMdict_english.zip](https://github.com/Ajatt-Tools/jmdict-rikaitan/releases/latest/download/JMdict_english.zip).
    This is the JMdict but without example sentences.

    This is the version of JMdict with example sentences from the [Tatoeba Project](http://tatoeba.org/home).
    Note that Tatoeba doesn't always have correct example sentences.
- JMdict (Other Languages).
  Be aware that the non-English dictionaries contain fewer entries
  than their English counterparts.
  Even if your primary language is not English,
  you may consider also importing the English version for better coverage.

## Don't import all Rikaitan dictionaries

You need to have a lot of dictionaries at hand
because Japanese to Japanese dictionaries always have gaps in them.
There will always be words that are in some dictionaries and not in others.

**A few examples:**
* `夢海鼠` is only in `日本国語大辞典`.
* `禿同` is only in `実用日本語表現辞典`.

Though you might think that using every dictionary in Rikaitan is a good idea
and load up all of them, I would advise you not to do so.
Sometimes the word that you're trying to look up
isn't the one that comes up first in the dictionary.
If you want to find it you have to scroll down,
and if you have many dictionaries imported this is going to be pretty annoying.

Each installed dictionary file causes Rikaitan's database to expand significantly
and take up to several GiB of disk space.

So what I recommend you to do instead is to have as few dictionaries as possible
and use Qolibri whenever there's a word that you can't find in Rikaitan.

## Custom CSS for images

If you want to use `デジタル大辞泉` or `旺文社国語辞典`,
images may render incorrectly unless you
append the following rules to your Popup CSS.
If this happens, go to Rikaitan settings > "Appearance" > "Configure custom CSS...".

<details>
<summary>Popup CSS for images</summary>

```css
.gloss-image-description {
    text-align: center;
}

.definition-item-content,
.gloss-image-link {
    max-width: 100%;
}

.gloss-image-container {
    background: none !important;
}

.gloss-image-link[data-has-aspect-ratio="true"] .gloss-image {
    position: static;
    max-height: 200px;
}

.gloss-image-link[data-has-aspect-ratio="true"] .gloss-image-aspect-ratio-sizer {
    display: none;
}

.gloss-image-container-overlay {
    display: none;
}

img {
    will-change: transform;
}
```

## Custom CSS for Kanji Dictionaries

Rikaitan's kanji dictionary viewer contains a lot of redundant information,
such as duplicated tags, stroke order diagrams and empty table rows for each entry.
To make the kanji entries more concise when using multiple kanji dictionaries,
you can add some CSS rules.

In "Settings" > "Popup Appearance" > "Configure custom CSS..."
paste the following CSS to condense displayed entries.

<details>
<summary>CSS for kanji</summary>

```css
/* remove misc dict classifications/codepoints/stats */
.kanji-glyph-data > tbody > tr:nth-child(n + 3) {
  display: none;
}

/* remove stroke diagram, freq, header for next entries */
div.entry[data-type='kanji']:nth-child(n + 2) .kanji-glyph-container,
div.entry[data-type='kanji']:nth-child(n + 2) [data-section-type='frequencies'],
div.entry[data-type='kanji']:nth-child(n + 2) table.kanji-glyph-data > tbody > tr:first-child {
  display: none;
}

/* remove 'No data found' */
.kanji-info-table-item-value-empty {
  display: none;
}

/* reduce extra padding */
.kanji-glyph-data,
div.entry[data-type='kanji'],
div.entry[data-type='kanji']:nth-child(n + 2) .kanji-glyph-data > tbody > tr > *,
.kanji-glyph-data dl.kanji-readings-japanese,
div.entry[data-type='kanji']:nth-child(n + 2)
  .kanji-glyph-data
  dl.kanji-readings-chinese[data-count='0'] {
  padding-top: 0 !important;
  padding-bottom: 0 !important;
  margin-bottom: 0em;
  margin-top: 0 !important;
}

/* remove horizontal lines */
.entry + .entry[data-type='kanji'],
div#dictionary-entries > div.entry:nth-child(n + 2) .kanji-glyph-data > tbody > tr > * {
  border-top: none !important;
}

/* change decimal list */
.kanji-gloss-list {
  list-style-type: circle;
}
```
