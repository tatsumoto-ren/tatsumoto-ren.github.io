Our [Anki decks](tag_decks.html) are organized into a comprehensive system
designed to guide learners through the process of mastering the Japanese language
using the [AJATT](whats-ajatt.html) method.

****

## Kana

Learning kana,
the Japanese writing system consisting of hiragana and katakana,
is the first step in learning Japanese.
If you haven't learned kana yet,
it's recommended to
read [Learning Kana In Two Days](learning-kana-in-two-days.html)
and complete one of the [kana decks](kana-anki-decks.html) before moving on.

## Beginner

[Ankidrone Foundation](jp1k-anki-deck.html)
contains the most fundamental vocabulary for beginners starting AJATT.
The deck makes it eaiser to recogznize kanji
by following the [JP1K](learning-kanji.html#jp1k-method) method.
The JP1K method instructs learners to actively recall kanji readings and meanings during card reviews,
without penalizing incorrect readings.
This approach allows beginners to focus on building a strong vocabulary base
while gradually improving their kanji reading skills.

## Mining deck

After completing Ankidrone Foundation,
all AJATTers must start building their own mining deck.
A mining deck is a personalized deck that you create yourself,
filling it with sentences you encounter while immersing in Japanese.
This process is known as [sentence mining](sentence-mining.html).

## Vocabulary

[Ankidrone Essentials](ankidrone-essentials.html)
is a supplementary deck that provides Targeted Sentence Cards
to be used alongside sentence mining.
The contents of the deck include words commonly used in daily life in Japan
and basic vocabulary used on the JLPT tests.
Learning this deck is not required,
as it can be substituted with sentence mining.
However,
we believe that many learners will benefit from it,
especially individuals who don't always have enough time in a day to create Anki cards.

## Sentences

[Ankidrone Sentence Pack](ankidrone-sentence-pack.html)
is a large collection of voiced sentences
that can be used as a [sentence bank](cross-profile-search-and-import.html).

****

By following this structured approach,
combined with immersion in native Japanese content,
learners can achieve fluency in the Japanese language
using the AJATT method.
