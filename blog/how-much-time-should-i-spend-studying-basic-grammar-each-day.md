It's up to you,
but we recommend spending around 15 to 30 minutes each day on [grammar](learning-grammar.html).
We all know that reading about grammar isn't exactly the most exciting thing in the world.
Thus,
we think that consuming grammar theory **incrementally** over time
will make it easier to consolidate and integrate what you've learned.

If you choose to spend about 30 minutes a day studying grammar,
it's perfectly fine to study basic grammar alongside
[Ankidrone Foundation](jp1k-anki-deck.html)
and/or
[Ankidrone Essentials](ankidrone-essentials.html).
