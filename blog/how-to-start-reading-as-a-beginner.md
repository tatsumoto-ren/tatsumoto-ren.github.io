Start watching movies, TV shows and anime with Japanese subtitles.
Read the subtitles and try to understand them.
Reading alongside audio is easy compared to *raw* reading practice,
so that's a good way to start, and that's how I started too.
The audio should guide you as you read.

Then try manga and eventually novels.
Use a popup dictionary (like [Rikaitan](setting-up-yomichan.html)) to look up unknown words.
