****

## Small kana

To type `ぁぃぅぇぉゃゅょ`,
type `x` before each corresponding sound.
E.g., to type `ゅ`, you actually type `xyu`.

## Repetition symbol 々

The character can be spelled `noma`
because it resembles the katakana `ノマ` smashed together.
Alternatively, you can try `onaji`.

## Yen symbol ￥

Press `＼` (backslash). Find `￥` among the predictions.

## Whitespace

The "　" (blank space) can be spelled as `kankaku`.

## Asterisk ※

Type `komejirushi` or `hoshi`.

## Middle dot ・

Type `nakaten` or `nakaguro`.

# N

Typing "xn" outputs ん.

# Overline ￣

Type `うえ`.

**Note**:
Overlines are used in the NHK accent dictionary to mark high
[pitch accent](japanese-pitch-accents.html), e.g. `いっぱい￣`.
When pitch drops, slashes are used `＼`.
