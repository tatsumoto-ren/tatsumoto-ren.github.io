Before I started learning Japanese, I had been learning English for many years.
I knew that to progress I had to watch and read a lot of native content.
I also knew from experience that
[classes](classes.html) and [textbooks](are-textbooks-bad.html)
are entirely useless and don't help.
I had an intuitive understanding of how one should learn a language,
but I knew nothing about Krashen, AJATT and immersion learning.

Discovering AJATT helped me understand why what I did to learn English worked.
It gave me a systemic view on the process of language acquisition
and a framework to talk about immersion learning.
