title: If I come across a word in kana, but the dictionary says the word also has kanji, do I kanjify the word when I make a targeted sentence card for it?

Yes.
When you make a card, convert the target word into kanji.
Khatzumoto did it all the time, and it's practically a common thing among ajatters.
I do it as well.

Examples:

* 沢山
* 鼬
* 蝸牛
* 海豚
* 蒟蒻

If you can read the kanji, then you can automatically read the kana.
But the reverse is not necessarily true.
If you can read the kana, it doesn't mean that you can read the kanji.
By learning the kanji version you're getting both at the same time.

Some might argue that learning kanjified words is more difficult,
but I don't see it as a big problem.
Memorizing kanji readings can be difficult in the beginning,
but it becomes easier with practice.
Moreover,
learning kanjified words helps create stronger memories.

If you already have a
[targeted sentence card](discussing-various-card-templates.html#targeted-sentence-cards)
that teaches the kanji version of a word,
then the next time you make a card that has that word in it,
you don't have to change it to kanji because it's not the **target word** anymore.
However,
if the word is written in kanji in the original text,
do not convert it to kana.

Most words in [Ankidrone Essentials](ankidrone-essentials.html)
are kanjified for this reason.
