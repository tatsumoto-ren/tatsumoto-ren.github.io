> Should I shoot for 100% mature cards?

1) Open the Anki Browser (shortcut: <kbd>b</kbd>).
2) From the left sidebar select the deck you want to check.
3) Add `is:new` to the search query.

If there are no *new* cards left, you're done.

Aiming at 100% mature cards is unreasonable.
When you fail a *mature* card, it might revert to a *young* card.

When you start a new deck,
continue reviewing your previous decks.
Forgetting is inevitable,
so you must review all your decks consistently to retain the material.
Alternatively,
you could keep all your cards in a single deck
or create subdecks within a main deck.
