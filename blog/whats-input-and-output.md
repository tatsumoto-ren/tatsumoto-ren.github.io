When we say *input* or [immersion](whats-immersion.html),
we mean any form of listening or reading in the target language.

When we say *output*,
we mean writing or speaking in the target language.

To begin to output we first need to acquire the language **through input**.
Output ability is the result of subconscious acquisition,
and this acquisition happens by comprehending input, AKA, speech and text,
in your target language (this is known as the [input hypothesis](what-is-comprehensible-input.html)).
