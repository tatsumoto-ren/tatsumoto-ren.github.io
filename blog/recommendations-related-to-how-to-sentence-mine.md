To make cards you can use [GoldenDict](setting-up-goldendict.html)
or [Yomichan](setting-up-yomichan.html).
There are also tools that help create cards depending on the type of media.
For movies and TV shows, I recommend [mpv scripts](mining-from-movies-and-tv-shows.html).
For manga, refer to my [Mining from manga](mining-from-manga.html) article to set up OCR.
When you can't use the sentence you've encountered the word in,
try to find [example sentences online](resources.html#examples-and-pronunciations).

When it comes to what card templates to use,
before 2020 I used to recommend sentence cards.
Now I don't recommend sentence cards anymore.
Instead, I recommend using TSCs and SWCs depending on the context.
For details, see [Discussing various card templates](discussing-various-card-templates.html).
