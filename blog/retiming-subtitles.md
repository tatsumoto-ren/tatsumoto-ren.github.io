Reading target language subtitles
is a great way to improve at your target language
and grow your vocabulary when watching movies and TV-shows.
Often,
after downloading an archive with subtitles for a show
you find that the subtitles are not in sync with the video files you have on your computer.
In this article let's discuss what you can do to sync them.

****

## Obtaining subtitles

Japanese subtitles can be found in
[Resources](resources.html#japanese-subtitles).

## Loading subtitles

[mpv](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Mpv)
can automatically detect and load subtitle files when opening a video.
To set mpv to load all subs containing media filename, enable `fuzzy` searching.
To be able to store subtitles in their own subfolder,
specify a list of desired folder names separated by colons in `sub-file-paths` parameter.

Add the following settings to `~/.config/mpv/mpv.conf`.

```
sub-auto=fuzzy
subs-with-matching-audio=yes
sub-file-paths=ass:srt:sub:subs:subtitles:subs.en:subs.ja
```

Although you can load a subtitle file if you drag and drop it into a mpv window,
this requires you to have a graphical file manager installed.
These days almost everyone uses terminal-based file managers.
I recommend renaming subtitles before opening a video to have mpv load them for you.
The best tool for doing it in my opinion is
[vidir](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/vidir/).
In addition to vidir, I advise you to install
[lf](https://github.com/gokcehan/lf).
It's an excellent terminal-based file manager.
You can configure it to bring `vidir` for you when you press a certain key.

Another helpful program you might need is
[atool](https://archlinux.org/packages/community/any/atool/).
Atool is going to help you extract archives
with subtitles downloaded from the Internet.

Add the following settings to `~/.config/lf/lfrc`.

```
# Set the `b` key to call vidir.
map b $vidir
# Extract archives by pressing `E`.
map E !atool -x $fx
```

Let's see how you can quickly rename subtitles with vidir.
For this example I took
[subs](https://kitsunekko.net/dirlist.php?dir=subtitles/japanese/Stein;Gate/&sort=date&order=desc)
for
[Steins;Gate](https://myanimelist.net/anime/9253/)
from
[Kitsunekko.net](resources.html#japanese-subtitles).
Watch
[this video on ![YouTube](img/youtube_logo.webp)](https://redirect.invidious.io/watch?v=qasLFv8Rv7o)
to get a gist of how it's done.

</video>

By default, `vidir` will try to use the text editor
that is set via the `EDITOR` [environment variable](how-do-i-change-an-environment-variable.html).
I have it set to `nvim`.
To use `nvim`, install [Neovim](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Neovim)
and add `export EDITOR="nvim"` as a new environment variable.

## Extracting internal subtitles

Often you want to extract internal subtitles to use them as reference for retiming.
Most likely the internal subtitles are going to be English fansubs
and the ones you want to retime are Japanese subtitles downloaded from kitsunekko.

To extract all internal subtitles from videos in a folder in one go you can use a bash loop.

```bash
for video in ./*.mkv; do
	ffmpeg -i "$video" -f srt "${video%.*}".srt
done
```

Sometimes a video contains multiple subtitle tracks.
To find out which one to extract, use `ffprobe`.

```bash
ffprobe -loglevel error -select_streams s -show_entries stream_tags=language,title:stream=index -of compact video.mkv
```

To select a stream to extract, specify the `-map` parameter.
E.g., to extract track #1 you use `-map 0:1`.

```bash
ffmpeg -i video.mkv -map 0:1 -f srt subs.srt
```

Similarly, use a bash loop to convert existing subtitles from one format to another.
You can swap `ass` and `srt` in the example.

```bash
for sub in ./*.ass; do
	ffmpeg -i "$sub" -f srt "${sub%.*}".srt
done
```

## Retiming methods

There are two methods of retiming subtitles available today:

1) Manually adjusting timings using the retimer included with
   [subs2srs](our-immersion-learning-toolset.html#subs2srs)
   or by adjusting the subtitle delay in mpv.
2) Using an automatic tool,
   [ffsubsync](https://github.com/smacke/ffsubsync)
   or
   [alass](https://github.com/kaegi/alass).

FFsubsync and alass fail to retime subtitle files with lots of commercial breaks
unless the same breaks are present in the video file, which is almost never the case.
Otherwise, the automatic tools are almost always faster than using a manual retimer.

## Manual retiming

### In mpv

If the timings are not too far off, you can adjust them in mpv by using built-in commands.

Add the following lines to `~/.config/mpv/input.conf`.

```
# Add/subtract 50 ms delay from subs
Z add sub-delay +0.05
z add sub-delay -0.05

# Adjust timing to previous/next subtitle
X sub-step 1
x sub-step -1
```

Try to find the right timings
by pressing `z`, `Z`, `x` and `X`.

* `z` and `Z` change the sub delay,
* `x` and `X` jump between adjacent subtitles.

### With subs2srs

[Subs2srs](our-immersion-learning-toolset.html#subs2srs) ships with a
[sub retimer tool](http://subs2srs.sourceforge.net/SubsReTimer/usage.html).
After you install subs2srs, you can find the retimer by its desktop entry.
This tool is helpful when you have a reference subtitle file that is already synced.
By selecting subtitle lines and pressing "Time shift"
you "copy" timings from one file to the other.
The retimer tool automatically applies time shifts
to all subtitle lines following the one you select.

## Automatic retiming

### With FFsubsync

[FFsubsync](https://github.com/smacke/ffsubsync)
is an automatic synchronization utility.
When synchronizing,
you can use a correctly synchronized subtitle file or a video
as a reference for synchronization.

To install FFsubsync, first install `ffmpeg`, `pipx`, then the program itself.

```bash
sudo pacman -S --needed ffmpeg python-pipx
pipx install ffsubsync
```

Read [Usage](https://github.com/smacke/ffsubsync#usage) on GitHub
to understand how to use the program to retime individual files.

I recommend retiming subtitles in bulk, using a bash-loop.
For this example let's say the videos are stored in the current directory,
the subtitle files I want to retime are stored in the `subs.ja` directory
the reference subtitles are stored in the `subs.en` directory
and all subtitles are in `ass` format.

This loop retimes all Japanese subs in the folder using the corresponding English subs as reference.

```bash
for reference in ./subs.en/*.ass; do
	to_retime=${reference//.en/.ja}
	retimed=${to_retime%.*}_retimed.${to_retime##*.}
	ffsubsync "$reference" -i "$to_retime" -o "$retimed"
done
```

This loop retimes all Japanese subs using the corresponding videos as reference.

```bash
for reference in ./*.mkv; do
	to_retime=./subs.ja/$(basename "${reference/.mkv/.ass}")
	retimed=${to_retime%.*}_retimed.${to_retime##*.}
	ffsubsync "$reference" -i "$to_retime" -o "$retimed"
done
```

### With alass

[alass](https://github.com/kaegi/alass)
is a program similar to FFsubsync.
It works exactly like FFsubsync but its command line interface differs a little.
Arch Linux users can install alass from
[the AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/?O=0&K=alass).
You can use the example bash loops shown above with alass
if you remove `-i` and `-o` since alass doesn't need them.
Refer to the docs on GitHub for more detailed instructions.

### With autosubsync-mpv

Retiming with FFsubsync and alass can be further automated by using
[autosubsync-mpv](https://github.com/Ajatt-Tools/autosubsync-mpv).
Autosubsync-mpv is an add-on for the mpv media player.
Watch
[this video](https://redirect.invidious.io/watch?v=w1vwnUiF6Bc)
to see how it works and how to set it up.

To use autosubsync-mpv first ensure that `mpv`, `ffmpeg`, `pipx` and `ffsubsync` are installed.
Run the following commands.

```bash
sudo pacman -S --needed mpv ffmpeg python-pipx
pipx install ffsubsync
```

Download and install the mpv add-on.

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.config/mpv/scripts/
git clone 'https://github.com/Ajatt-Tools/autosubsync-mpv' ~/.config/mpv/scripts/autosubsync
```

When you watch a video in mpv,
press `n` to bring the add-on's menu.
It's going to give you the following options:

* Sync to audio
* Sync to another subtitle
* Save current timings.

Choose `Sync to another subtitle` if you have a reference subtitle in another language.
Otherwise, choose `Sync to audio`.
If you have made changes to the timings by pressing `z` and `Z` in mpv,
you have an option to permanently save them to a file if you choose `Save current timings`.
