[Immersion](whats-immersion.html) is the cornerstone of [AJATT](whats-ajatt.html),
with the [SRS](spaced-repetition.html) serving as an optional supplement.
While [Anki](setting-up-anki.html)
or other SRS applications can be useful for helping learn vocabulary faster,
it is possible to become fluent without using them.
If using an SRS reduces your motivation or enjoyment,
it may be in your best interest to forgo using any SRS
and instead focus on the core of the method.

To improve learning speed and efficiency,
it is recommended to incorporate some form of repetition,
provided [you can tolerate it](minimum-amount-of-anki.html).
We eventually forget [everything that we don't review](how-much-reading-is-required-to-counteract-not-srsing.html).
While total, mass immersion can partially counteract the forgetting curve,
it can't help when trying to memorize more uncommon words.

In the case of Japanese,
the SRS proves especially useful
because it helps you learn how to read words written in kanji
and ensures that you don't forget kanji readings.
It is particularly helpul when dealing with rare kanji.

Personally,
I have observed that the majority of my failed Anki reviews
stem from forgotten kanji readings.
I may recall the meaning of a word, but struggle to recall its pronunciation.
Therefore, if your target language does not utilize kanji or hanzi characters,
it is totally fine to omit the use of Anki.
