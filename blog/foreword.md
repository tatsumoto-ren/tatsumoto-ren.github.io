I'm Tatsumoto Ren,
and I'm excited to help you begin your journey to learn Japanese.
This guide is designed specifically for individuals who want to master Japanese
through **self-study**,
without relying on traditional textbooks and classes.
Are you eager to take control of your learning
and achieve a high level of fluency faster than with any other method in the world?
If so, you're in the right place.
This site is dedicated to providing you
with the theory, strategies, and tools you need to succeed.

## Our approach

<img src="img/dekinai.webp" float="right">

We divide the process of learning any foreign language into two major steps.

1) Learn to understand the language at a high level.
2) Use your comprehension to learn to speak the language by mimicking native speakers.
   This is similar to how kids do it.

We focus on understanding before speaking, or input before output.
If you want to learn how to draw, you've got to be able to see before you can draw.
You can't have a conversation if you can't understand what the other person says.

This approach makes the journey easy and fun
because from day one you are encouraged to learn from compelling content
made for native speakers of your target language.
Most people who persevered and reached fluency
watched their favorite TV shows in Japanese
and read lots of books and manga every day.
No amount of brute force can get you there,
so forget about traditional approaches such as taking classes or hiring a tutor.

## All Japanese All the Time

The method explained here is widely known as
[AJATT](whats-ajatt.html),
or All Japanese All the Time.
It is directed at people who want to get to fluency as fast as possible
by spending a lot of time with the language.
The key component to succeeding with AJATT is engaging with the language every day,
all the time,
going as hardcore as you can.

The logic is very simple.
The more time each day is spent learning,
the faster one arrives at the destination.
And of course, the learning process must be efficient.
AJATT optimizes learning to achieve the best results.
But since studying is boring and exhausting,
AJATT strives to make learning fun and interesting.
We recommend learning from the language that real native speakers actually use
because textbooks, courses, classes and apps don't teach how people really speak.

AJATT has very little formal structure
and doesn't try to force any particular workflow.
You learn the most common words, study basic grammar,
but after that you are taught how to dive into authentic content.
You learn new things as they come up in the content.

The emphasis is very strong on input and comprehension in the beginning.
You try to get to understand Japanese perfectly
before concerning with trying to produce Japanese yourself.

## It's free

It is important to be mindful of your finances when learning a foreign language.
I learned Japanese without spending any money, and I encourage you to do so too.
Everything you need to master Japanese can be found here and online.
There is no limit to the amount of media and books you can absorb.
With torrents, you can find any anime, drama, or manga ever made.
The internet provides an unlimited number of resources for Japanese media.
Additionally, you can easily access [dictionaries](tag_dictionaries.html),
grammar guides,
and software to facilitate your language learning.

## Technology

You are going to need a desktop computer or a laptop to learn Japanese effectively.
This is because it's a lot easier to work with text when you have a physical keyboard.
We use a variety of
[software](our-immersion-learning-toolset.html)
to help in the learning process.
The tools introduced in this guide are
[free as in freedom](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html).
We use what we recommend.
We don't endorse
[proprietary software](https://www.gnu.org/proprietary/proprietary.html)
and services that mistreat their users.
