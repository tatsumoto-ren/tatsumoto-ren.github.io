Ankidrone Sentence Pack is an Anki deck
that contains over 44,000 Japanese sentence with native audio.
This deck is not to be learned from back to back,
its purpose is to aid you in finding example sentences
for your targeted sentence cards.

****

There are times when you want to mine a new word you've found in your immersion
but the sentence it appears in is not
[1T](one-target-sentences.html)
for you.
In such situations you can either make a
[SWC](discussing-various-card-templates.html#simple-word-cards)
or search in a sentence bank.
I encourage you to build your own sentence bank
using tools like
[subs2srs](our-immersion-learning-toolset.html#subs2srs)
or
[mpvacious](mining-from-movies-and-tv-shows.html).
If you don't have a bank yet,
**Ankidrone Sentence Pack** is going to be a good starting point
and the first building block of your bank.

The deck is a complete offline copy of the
[Sentence Search](https://sentencesearch.neocities.org/)
website.
The list of sentences used on the site can be found
[here](https://receptomanijalogi.web.app/site/data/all_v11.json).
Each sentence has a tag that indicates the underlying source.

Audio files were converted from mp3 to a superior
[Opus](https://opus-codec.org/)
format to save disk space.
Anki supports Opus on both PC and Android.

Sentence Search contains sentences from the Core10k deck (iKnow, core10k)
and Tango decks ([Ankidrone Essentials](ankidrone-essentials.html)),
thus this data is also present in **Ankidrone Sentence Pack**.
If you already have these decks in your collection,
delete the duplicates after importing the deck.

If you have a different profile to store your sentence bank,
use [Cross Profile Search And Import](useful-anki-add-ons-for-japanese.html#cross-profile-search-and-import)
to copy cards from the bank profile to your main profile.

This deck is **not** a replacement for
[Ankidrone Essentials](ankidrone-essentials.html).
It doesn't contain dictionary definitions.
I recommend you start with **Ankidrone Essentials** if you're a beginner.
