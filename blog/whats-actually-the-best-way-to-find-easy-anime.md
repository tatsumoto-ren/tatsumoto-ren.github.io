When I learned Japanese,
I didn't worry about categorizing anime into *easy* VS *hard*.
The first anime I mined after making my mining deck was Steins;Gate.
Although it isn't the simplest anime if you count the difficulty of every word,
it wasn't hard to mine from it.
I simply went through it line by line,
adding every sentence with unknown words to Anki.

For beginners,
it's fine to start with
[any slice of life anime](what-good-things-are-there-to-watch-for-a-complete-beginner.html)
without stressing over the difficulty.

Don't try to mine sentences right from day one.
I only began sentence mining after I had learned more than 1,000 words
[from a premade deck](basic-vocabulary.html).

There are many resources that claim to organize anime by difficulty for Japanese learners.
I think it's best to avoid them.
They often miss the mark,
potentially leading you to anime that isn't interesting or suitable for your level.
Plus,
many of these resources require you to create an account
and come with questionable money-grab schemes.
If you find an anime that looks fun, it's probably the best one for you personally.
