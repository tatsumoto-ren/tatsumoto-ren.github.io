3000 Essential Vocabulary for the JLPT N1,
also known as JLPT Tango N1,
is a textbook to prepare for the JLPT N1.
It contains ~2000 Japanese sentences and their English translations.
The book includes vocabulary found commonly on the JLPT and often used in everyday life.

With the help of our chat members,
we have created an Anki deck from
sentences listed in the book
and native audio that comes with it.

## About

After [JLPT Tango N2 Anki deck](jlpt-tango-n2-anki-deck.html) was released,
we started working on the N1 deck.
We took sentences from the book,
downloaded audio from the publisher's website
and combined them to make this Anki deck.

This deck is meant to be used with the
[AJATT method](table-of-contents.html)
of language learning.
It assumes that you are immersing in Japanese media,
mining sentences
and studying Japanese grammar
on your own.
We recommend this deck if you want to learn vocabulary for the JLPT N1,
frontload <span title="We find JLPT N1 vocabulary rather basic">basic vocabulary</span>
to increase your comprehension or to aid the process of [sentence mining](sentence-mining.html).

The deck has cards formatted as bilingual
[targeted sentence cards](discussing-various-card-templates.html#targeted-sentence-cards).
A sentence is shown on the front,
the target word on the front is highlighted.
Readings, translation, meanings of words and audio are on the back.
Refer to the linked article if you don't know how to review TSCs.

<p align="center"><i>A card from JLPT Tango N1.</i></p>

Each card also comes with a `MakeProductionCard` field that, when filled, turns the card into a
[production TSC](writing-japanese.html#writing-kanji).
On a production TSC the target word is spelled in kana,
and you have to recall how to write it in kanji.

As it should be obvious by its title,
the book was designed with the Japanese Language Proficiency Test in mind.
However, we were interested in the book for quite different purposes.
You can download audio recordings
for all the sentences in the book from the publisher's website.
By combining audio with the sentences extracted from the book
we were able to create a **high quality TSC deck**.

## Download

To download the deck, get [Ankidrone Essentials](ankidrone-essentials.html) version 7 or later.

## The Rest of the Tango Series

The JLPT Tango N1 book is actually one in a series of JLPT prep books.
There are five books total, one for each level of the JLPT.
Prior to starting this deck I advise you to complete Tango N5, N4, N3 and N2 decks.
They are available as a part of Ankidrone Essentials.

## How To Study

If you follow the method of language learning described on this site,
by the time you start this deck,
you should already be doing [sentence mining](sentence-mining.html).
While you go through the cards in the deck,
delete the ones you already know.

We recommend continuing to sentence mine
while learning cards from the deck.
Learn between 10~30 cards a day total.
Keep in mind that the more new cards you learn each day,
the more daily reviews you'll have in the long term.

## Commentary

This is the last deck in the Tango series.
Its release completes Ankidrone Essentials,
the basic vocabulary deck I worked on for two years.
Ankidrone Essentials has been immensely successful,
and since it first came out in February 2020
it has helped thousands of people with studying Japanese.

The work is not totally over though.
If there are any typos or errors found,
I will be correcting them and uploading new versions.

While editing the deck I went through every sentence present in it.
My impression is that
the words featured in the book are easy enough
to be correctly described as *basic vocabulary*.
I don't know if this is what JLPT N1 is supposed to be like.
If I take JLPT in the future, I might be able to tell
whether the books match the test levels they're marketed for.

However,
if you're doing AJATT and aren't planning to prepare for JLPT,
the Tango decks should be a perfect supplement for you.
They contain easy and common words,
and going through the decks will help you better understand your immersion.
