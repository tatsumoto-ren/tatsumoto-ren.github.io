## Matrix

We have a very rich and vibrant community on
[Matrix](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Matrix).
Matrix is great because it's a completely libre communication protocol.
Matrix is federated and consists of many servers, much like Email.
Different Matrix servers are able to talk to each other.
Before you join, install a
[Matrix client](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/List_of_applications/Internet#Matrix_clients)
and register an account on one of the [servers](list-of-matrix-servers.html).
If you're new to Matrix, read [Matrix quickstart guide](matrix-quickstart-guide.html).

<a target="_blank" class="md-button element" href="https://matrix.to/#/#join:midov.pl">Join us on Element</a>

If you already have a Matrix client,
you can simply open it and join `#join:midov.pl`.

When you join the community, you'll start in *Starting Lounge*.
This is a room for new members.
From there you can explore our community
by following the links in the room's description.
Note that `matrix.org` users aren't allowed to join any other rooms
except Starting Lounge and a couple others.

If you want to keep in touch from an Android device,
install [Element for Android](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/im.vector.app/).

## Telegram

[Telegram](https://telegram.org/)
is a messenger with a focus on speed and security.
Although Telegram
[is not ideal](https://spyware.neocities.org/articles/telegram.html)
it is still better than many proprietary services.
To use Telegram on GNU/Linux, install
[the official desktop client](https://archlinux.org/packages/?name=telegram-desktop).

## Rules

1) **Speak English.**
Do not use your Japanese unless you're already fluent.
Remember that [talking is not practicing](https://redirect.invidious.io/watch?v=NiTsduRreug&t=352s).
Your time is better spent immersing.
1) **Be ethical.**
Do not post promotions or spam unrelated to learning Japanese.
However, feel free to share with us your learning resources.
Be minimally polite, don't troll and don't post porn.
1) **Stay on topic.**
Try to keep the conversation centered around
immersion, software for language learning,
Japanese language, the country and its culture.
Everything else should be discussed in the room dedicated to off-topic
which you'll find after you've joined.
1) **Read the guide.**
Most questions we get are already answered in [our guide](table-of-contents.html).
Our members are volunteering their time to help everybody.
Try to reduce the amount of reoccurring questions so that everyone has more time to immerse.
1) **No proprietary software.**
We don't use, support or recommend
[proprietary software](https://www.gnu.org/proprietary/).
We use
[free/libre software](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html)
because it is naturally more extensible and user-friendly.

*Certain rooms may have their own sets of rules.*

## Questions

If you have a question specifically for me,
ping me in the chat by prepending your message with
`@tatsumoto:cutefunny.art` on Matrix or `@tatsumoto` on Telegram.

## Community stickers

If you're a Telegram user, installing
[our community sticker pack](https://t.me/addstickers/ajatt)
is easy, you just click on the link.
On Matrix, it's a little more tricky.
You need to host your stickers yourself.
See the
[stickerpicker](https://github.com/maunium/stickerpicker)
GitHub repo and
[this video](https://redirect.invidious.io/watch?v=Yz3H6KJTEI0)
for detailed instructions.
To use our Telegram stickers on Matrix,
import them to your self-hosted repo using the `sticker-import` command
or copy the URL of
[the pack I host for myself](https://tatsumoto-ren.github.io/stickerpicker/web/).
To add the sticker pack to your Matrix account, follow the instructions
[here](https://github.com/maunium/stickerpicker/wiki/Enabling-the-widget).
