## Rules

1) **Speak English.**
Do not use your Japanese unless you're already fluent.
Remember that [talking is not practicing](https://redirect.invidious.io/watch?v=NiTsduRreug&t=352s).
Your time is better spent immersing.
1) **Be ethical.**
Do not post promotions or spam unrelated to learning Japanese.
However, feel free to share with us your learning resources.
Be minimally polite, don't troll and don't post porn.
1) **Stay on topic.**
Try to keep the conversation centered around
immersion, software for language learning,
Japanese language, the country and its culture.
Everything else should be discussed in the room dedicated to off-topic
which you'll find after you've joined.
1) **Read the guide.**
Most questions we get are already answered in [our guide](table-of-contents.html).
Our members are volunteering their time to help everybody.
Try to reduce the amount of reoccurring questions so that everyone has more time to immerse.
1) **No proprietary software.**
We don't use, support or recommend
[proprietary software](https://www.gnu.org/proprietary/).
We use
[free/libre software](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html)
because it is naturally more extensible and user-friendly.

*Certain rooms may have their own sets of rules.*

## Matrix

> Starting Lounge: `#join:g33k.se`

We have a very rich and vibrant community on
[Matrix](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Matrix).
Matrix is great because it's a completely libre communication protocol.
Matrix is federated and consists of many servers, much like Email.
Different Matrix servers are able to talk to each other.
Before you join, install a
[Matrix client](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/List_of_applications/Internet#Matrix_clients)
and register an account on one of the servers
[listed here](list-of-matrix-servers.html).
If you're new to Matrix, read [Matrix quickstart guide](matrix-quickstart-guide.html).

<a target="_blank" class="md-button element" href="element://vector/webapp/#/room/#join:g33k.se">Join us on Element</a>

If the button above doesn't work,
open your client of choice and join `#join:g33k.se`.
If you can't or don't want to install a client, use a
[web app](https://c.wfr.moe/#/room/#join:g33k.se)
([alternative](https://webchat.kde.org/#/room/#join:g33k.se)).

When you join the community, you'll start in *Starting Lounge*.
This is a room for new members.
From there you can explore our community
by following the link in the room's description.

If you want to keep in touch from an Android device,
install [Element for Android](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/im.vector.app/).

## Telegram

[Telegram](https://telegram.org/)
is a messenger with a focus on speed and security.
Although Telegram
[is not ideal](https://spyware.neocities.org/articles/telegram.html)
it is still better than many proprietary services.
To use Telegram on GNU/Linux, install
[the official desktop client](https://archlinux.org/packages/?name=telegram-desktop).

## Questions

If you have a question specifically for me,
ping me in the chat by prepending your message with
`@tatsumoto:g33k.se` on Matrix or `@tatsumoto` on Telegram.

## Community stickers

If you're a Telegram user, installing
[our community sticker pack](https://t.me/addstickers/ajatt)
is easy, you just click on the link.
On Matrix, it's a little more tricky.
You need to host your stickers yourself.
See the
[stickerpicker](https://github.com/maunium/stickerpicker)
GitHub repo and
[this video](https://redirect.invidious.io/watch?v=Yz3H6KJTEI0)
for detailed instructions.
To use our Telegram stickers on Matrix,
import them to your self-hosted repo using the `sticker-import` command
or copy the URL of
[the pack I host for myself](https://tatsumoto-ren.github.io/stickerpicker/web/).
To add the sticker pack to your Matrix account, follow the instructions
[here](https://github.com/maunium/stickerpicker/wiki/Enabling-the-widget).
