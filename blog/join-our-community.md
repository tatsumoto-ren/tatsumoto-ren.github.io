## Rules

1) **Speak English.**
Do not use your Japanese unless you're already fluent.
Remember that [talking is not practicing](https://redirect.invidious.io/watch?v=NiTsduRreug&t=352s).
Your time is better spent immersing.
1) **Be ethical.**
Do not post promotions or spam unrelated to learning Japanese.
However, feel free to share with us your learning resources.
Be minimally polite, don't troll and don't post porn.
1) **Stay on topic.**
Try to keep the conversation centered around
immersion, software for language learning,
Japanese language, the country and its culture.
Everything else should be discussed in the room dedicated to off-topic
which you'll find after you've joined.
1) **Read the guide.**
Most questions we get are already answered in [our guide](table-of-contents.html).
Our members are volunteering their time to help everybody.
Try to reduce the amount of reoccurring questions so that everyone has more time to immerse.
1) **No proprietary software.**
We don't use, support or recommend
[proprietary software](https://www.gnu.org/proprietary/).
We use
[free/libre software](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html)
because it is naturally more extensible and user-friendly.
