Don't change anything in the grading process.
Just have [pitch accent](japanese-pitch-accents.html) information on the back of your cards
but don't take it into account when grading yourself.

If you force yourself to recall the target word **and** its pitch accent at the same time,
failure to recall any of the two will result in a failed card.
For example,
you will have to fail a card if you remember what the word means but don't remember its accent.
Piotr Wozniak in his 20 rules basically says not to do it.

To learn pitch accents of individual words you should make separate cards.
Have a word on the front of the card and its pitch accent on the back.

For example:

| Front                                | Back       |
| ---                                  | ---        |
| What's the accent of 出来る?         | 中高 （2） |
| What's the accent of 入る（はいる）? | 頭高 （1） |

If a word has multiple readings,
you need to include furigana on the front as well.
