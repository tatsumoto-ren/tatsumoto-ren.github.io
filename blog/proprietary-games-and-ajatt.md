If someone's only [motivation](im-not-motivated-and-dont-enjoy-learning-japanese.html)
is playing a specific set of [games](are-video-games-good-for-immersion.html),
that's a recipe for quitting once they've finished those games.
Try to broaden your content choices so you always have something to do in Japanese.
If you spend too long searching for content,
your immersion is paused and you don't progress.
To succeed with Japanese
you need both [active](active-immersion.html) and [passive](passive-immersion.html) immersion,
and games alone won't cover everything.

This situation where you have only [proprietary](https://www.gnu.org/proprietary/proprietary.html)
options and no [free](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html) alternatives
isn't unique to language learning.
I think [Richard Stallman](https://stallman.org/) would say that if there's no libre alternative,
he'd still refuse to run the proprietary version.
From a software-freedom perspective,
not running proprietary software preserves your freedom just as much as running free software.
